abstract = {The paper analyses the problem of optimizing the profile of a non-tubular adhesive bonded lap joint under torsion. The joint considered consists of two thin rectangular section beams bonded together along a side surface. The aim of the investigation is to make the joint uniformly resistant to torsion, without however weakening it in other stress situations: the result is a stronger and lighter structural element. The predominant stress field developed in the adhesive at the bond area between the two beams in single-lap and scarf joints is determined. The stress field pattern is highly nonlinear along the longitudinal coordinate (joint axis) and is heavily dependent on joint geometry: maximum stresses are reached at the ends of the adhesive for the first type of joint, and along its centreline for the second type. An intermediate type of joint can be produced by modifying the joint profile, thus ensuring that the stress field is constant along the longitudinal coordinate and thereby optimizing the joint for uniform torsional strength.},

abstract = {The paper analyzes the problem of torsion in an adhesive non-tubular bonded single-lap joint. The joint considered consists of two thin rectangular section beams bonded together along a side surface. Assuming the materials involved to be governed by linear elastic laws, equilibrium and compatibility equations were used to arrive at an integro-differential relation whose solution makes it possible to determine torsional moment section by section in the bonded joint between the two beams. This is then used to determine the predominant stress and strain field at the beam-adhesive interface (stress field along the direction perpendicular to the interface plane, equivalent to the applied torsional moment and the corresponding strain field) and the joint's elastic strain (absolute and relative rotations of the bonded beam cross sections). All the relations presented were obtained in closed form. Results obtained theoretically are compared with those given by a three dimensional finite element numerical model.

The experimental analysis is carried out on specimens with three different size-scales, three different values of slenderness and two boundary conditions. The numerical analysis was carried out by taking into account the initial random crack distribution, considering the mutual crack interaction, the crack-boundary interaction and the internal friction between the faces of the cracks. The numerical results, in good agreement with the experimental data, highlight the characteristic strain-softening behaviour of quasi-brittle materials, and the influence of size-scale and slenderness on the structural response. By observing the evolution of the crack patterns, it is possible to emphasize, both experimentally and numerically, the transition from crushing to splitting collapse by increasing the specimen slenderness, as well as the transition from ductile to brittle behaviour by increasing the specimen size-scale.},

The analysis is carried out by taking into account the initial crack distribution, which cannot be neglected if the experimental reality (developing over three scales of observation, micro-, meso- and macro-scale) is to be modeled. The algorithm permits us to follow the evolution of the crack geometry during the loading process, which is characterized, at each step, by the propagation of the most critical meso- or macro-crack. Moreover, in order to take into account the micro-crack effect causing the progressive decay of the material, a decreasing variation of the elastic modulus is assumed, depending on the strain energy density absorbed during the loading process. Different geometries, with different slenderness and size scale, are analyzed by the proposed model, with and without friction between specimen and loading platens.

abstract = {In this paper a general study on tubular adhesive joint under axial load is presented. We focus our attention on both static and dynamic behavior of the joint, including shear and normal stresses and strains in the adhesive layer, joint optimization, failure load for brittle crack propagation, and crack detection based on free vibrations. First, we have considered the shear and normal stresses and strains in the adhesive layer to propose an optimization to uniform axial strength (UAS) and to reduce the stress peaks in the bond. The stress analysis confirms that the maximum shear stresses are attained at the ends of the adhesive and that the peak of maximum shear stress is reached at the end of the stiffer tube and does not tend to zero as the adhesive length approaches infinity. A fracture energy criterion to predict brittle crack propagation for conventional and optimized joint is presented. The stability of brittle crack propagation and the strength of the joint, as well as the ductile-brittle failure transition, are analyzed. A detection method to predict crack severity, based on joint dynamic behavior, is also proposed. The crack detection is achieved through the determination of the axial natural frequencies of the joint as a function of the crack length, by determining the roots of a determinantal equation.},

To obtain a statistically significant fragment production as well as the total energy dissipated in a given specimen, the experimental procedure was unusually carried outup to a strain of approximately -95%, practically corresponding to the initial fragment compaction between the loading platens. The experimental fragment analysis suggests a fractal law for the distribution in particle size; this simply means that fragments derived from a given specimen appear geometrically self-similar at each observation scale. In addition, clear size effects on dissipated energy density are experimentally observed. Fractal concepts permit to quantify the correlation between fragment size distribution and size effect on dissipated energy density, the latter being governed by the total surface area of produced fragments. The experimental results agree with the proposed multi-scale interpretation satisfactorily. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In particular, a comparison with the results of an experimental investigation-only recently published-performed during 28 and 42 months of in-flight exposure for the MIR orbital space station, is presented. The experimental analysis gives the mass loss of polymer films, used as protection against erosion due to space debris impacts, as a function of in-flight exposure time, as well as their life-time predictions, crucial parameters for an optimal design of the protective films. The theoretical approach predicts a catastrophic damage evolution in terms of eroded mass as a function of the exposure time.

The differentials in Griffith's criterion are substituted with finite differences; the implications are remarkable. Fracture of tiny systems with a given geometry and type of loading occurs at 'quantized' stresses that are well predicted by QFM: strengths predicted by QFM are compared with experimental results on carbon nanotubes, $\beta$-SiC nanorods, $\alpha$-Si3N4 whiskers, and polysilicon thin films; and also with molecular mechanics/dynamics simulation of fracture of carbon nanotubes and graphene with cracks and holes, and statistical mechanics-based simulations on fracture of two-dimensional spring networks. QFM is self-consistent, agreeing to first-order with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), and to second-order with non-linear fracture mechanics (NLFM). For vanishing crack length QFM predicts a finite ideal strength in agreement with Orowan's prediction. In contrast to LEFM, QFM has no restrictions on treating defect size and shape. The different fracture Modes (opening I, sliding II and tearing III), and the stability of the fracture propagations, are treated in a simple way.},

In particular, we analyze the continuous deformation and instability (pull in) of a clamped-clamped nanotube suspended over an electrode from which a potential differential is imposed. The transformation of an applied voltage into a nanomechanical deformation indeed represents a key step toward the design of innovative nanodevices. Likewise, accurate prediction of pull-in/pull-out voltages is highly needed. We show that an energy-based method can be conveniently used to predict the structural behavior and instability corresponding to the ON/OFF states of the device at the so-called pull-in voltage. The analysis reveals that finite kinematics effects can result in a significant increase of the pull-in voltage.

abstract = {This paper describes a modification to the traditional Griffith energy balance as used in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The modification involves using a finite amount of crack extension ($\Delta$a) instead of an infinitesimal extension (da) when calculating the energy release rate. We propose to call this method finite fracture mechanics (FFM). This leads to a change in the Griffith equation for brittle fracture, introducing a new term $\Delta$a/2: we denote this length as L and assume that it is a material constant. This modification is extremely useful because it allows LEFM to be used to make predictions in two situations in which it is normally invalid: short cracks and notches. It is shown that accurate predictions can be made of both brittle fracture and fatigue behaviour for short cracks and notches in a range o different materials. The value of L can be expressed as a function of two other material constants: the fracture toughness Kc (or threshold $\Delta$Kth in the case of fatigue) and an inherent strength parameter $\sigma$0. For the particular cases of fatigue-limit prediction in metals and brittle fracture in ceramics, it is shown that $\sigma$0 coincides directly with the ultimate tensile strength (or, in fatigue, the fatigue limit), as measured on plain, unnotched specimens. For brittle fracture in polymers and metals, in which larger amounts of plasticity precede fracture, the approach can still be used but $\sigma$0 takes on a different value, higher than the plain-specimen strength, which can be found from experimental data. Predictions can be made very easily for any problem in which the stress intensity factor, K is known as a function of crack length. Furthermore, it is shown that the predictions of this method, FFM, are similar to those of a method known as the line method (LM) in which failure is predicted based on the average stress along a line drawn ahead of the crack or notch. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

To predict this behaviour, a non-local theory, basically based on the Novozhilov's hypothesis of existence of a fracture quantum, is herein presented.

Assuming continuum mechanics, the complete nonlinear equation of the elastic line of the nanotube is derived and then numerically solved. In particular, we study singly and doubly clamped nanotubes under electrostatic actuation. The analysis emphasizes the importance of nonlinear kinematics effects in the prediction of the pull-in voltage of the device, a key design parameter. Moreover, the nonlinear behavior associated with finite kinematics (i.e., large deformations), neglected in previous studies, as well as charge concentrations at the tip of singly clamped nanotubes, are investigated in detail. We show that nonlinear kinematics results in an important increase in the pull-in voltage of doubly clamped nanotube devices, but that it is negligible in the case of singly clamped devices. Likewise, we demonstrate that charge concentration at the tip of singly clamped devices results in a significant reduction in pull-in voltage. By comparing numerical results to analytical predictions, closed form formulas are verified.

abstract = {A new quantum action-based theory, dynamic quantized fracture mechanics (DQFM), is presented that modifies continuum-based dynamic fracture mechanics (DFM). The crack propagation is assumed as quantized in both space and time. The static limit case corresponds to quantized fracture mechanics (QFM), that we have recently developed to predict the strength of nanostructures. DQFM predicts the well-known forbidden strength and crack speed bands - observed in atomistic simulations - which are unexplained by continuum-based approaches. In contrast to DFM and linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), that are shown to be limiting cases of DQFM and which can treat only large (with respect to the "fracture quantum") and sharp cracks under moderate loading speed, DQFM has no restrictions on treating defect size and shape, or loading rate. Simple examples are discussed (i) strengths predicted by DQFM for static loads are compared with experimental and numerical results on carbon nanotubes containing nanoscale defects; (ii) the dynamic fracture initiation toughness predicted by DQFM is compared with experimental results on microsecond range impact failures of 2024-T3 aircraft aluminum alloy. Since LEFM has been successfully applied also at the geophysics size-scale, it is conceivable that DQFM theory can treat objects that span at least 15 orders of magnitude in size. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

abstract = {The problem of the evaluation of the generalized stress-intensity factors for re-entrant corners in multi-layered structural components is addressed. An approximate analytical model based on the theory of multi-layered beams is presented. This approach provides a simple closed-form solution for the direct computation of the Mode I stress-intensity factor for the general problem of a re-entrant corner symmetrically meeting a bi-material interface. For the self-consistency of the theory, re-entrant corners in homogeneous materials and cracks perpendicular to bi-material interfaces can also be gained as limit cases of this formulation. According to this approach, the effects of the elastic mismatch parameters, the value of the notch angle and the thicknesses of the layers on the stress-intensity factor are carefully quantified and the results are compared with FE solutions. FE results are obtained by applying a combination of analytical and numerical techniques based on the knowledge a priori of the asymptotic stress field for re-entrant corners perpendicular to a bi-material interface and on the use of generalized isoparametric singular finite elements at the notch tip. A good agreement between approximate and analytical/numerical predictions is achieved, showing the effectiveness of this approach. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to introduce a new failure criterion in the framework of Finite Fracture Mechanics. Criteria assuming that failure of quasi-brittle materials is affected by stress or energy flux acting on a finite distance in front of the crack tip are widely used inside the scientific community. Generally, this distance is assumed to be small compared to a characteristic size of the structure, i.e. to any length describing the macroscale. A key point of the present paper is to analyse what happens if the smallness assumption does not hold true. The proposed approach relies on the assumption that the finite distance is not a material constant but a structural parameter. Its value is determined by a condition of consistency of both energetic and stress approaches. The model is general. In order to check its soundness, an application to the strength prediction for three point bending tests of various relative crack depths and of different sizes is performed. It is seen that, for the un-notched specimens, the present model predicts the same trend as the Multi-Fractal Scaling Law (MFSL). Finally, a comparison with experimental data available in the literature on high strength concrete three point bending specimens is performed, showing an excellent agreement. It is remarkable to observe that the method presented herein is able to provide the fracture toughness using test data from un-notched specimens, as long as the range of specimen sizes is broad enough. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper various deterministic and statistical models, based on new quantized theories proposed by the author, are presented for estimating the strength of a real, and thus defective, space elevator cable. The cable, ∼100 000km in length, is composed of carbon nanotubes, ∼100nm long: thus, its design involves nanomechanicsand megamechanics. The predicted strengths are extensively compared with the experimental and atomistic simulation results for carbon nanotubes available in the literature. All these approaches unequivocally suggest that the megacable strength will be reduced by a factor at least of ∼70% with respect to the theoretical nanotube strength, today (erroneously) assumed in the cable design. The reason is the unavoidable presence of defects in so huge a cable. Preliminary in-silicon tensile experiments confirm the same finding. The deduced strength reduction is sufficient to place in doubt the effective realization of the space elevator, that if built as designed today will certainly break (in the author's opinion). The mechanics of the cable is also revised and possible damage sources discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of brittle crack propagation and fatigue crack growth in functionally graded materials (FGMs) is addressed. The proposed analytical approach can be used to estimate the variation of the stress-intensity factor as a function of the crack length in FGMs. Furthermore, according to the Paris' law, the fatigue life and the crack-tip velocity of crack propagation can be predicted in the case of fatigue crack growth. A comparison with numerical results obtained according to the Finite Element method will show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Detailed examples are provided in the case of three-point bending beam problems with either a FGM interlayer, or a FGM external coating. A comparison is presented between two types of grading in the elastic modulus: a continuous linear variation in the FGM layer and a discrete approximation with a multi-layered beam and a constant Young's modulus in each layer. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

In particular, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, critical normal and shear stresses and strains, fracture and fragmentation energies, fracture toughness and coefficient of thermal expansion are deduced. Even if the approach partially recalls the classical solid state physics treatment and gives estimations rather than exact predictions, new interesting aspects clearly emerge from the analysis. According to the proposed simple but general model, a preliminary periodic table for the nanomechanical properties of the elements is presented for the first time. The periodicity of the mechanical properties, similarly to the well-known periodicity of the electronic properties, is clearly emphasized.

While this at first may seem evident, to our knowledge, so far no theoretical argument has been presented explaining this relationship explicitly. In here, we therefore develop a conceptual framework based on the so-called 'universal scaling law' and then support our conjecture through evaluation with experimental data. Our concept suggests not only that cancer tissue invasion operates with relatively few and thin branches of mobile cells but also that this overall tumor surface expansion, and the diffusion of nutrients that it enables, can nourish the tumor prior to the impact of neovascularization. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding fracture, we have focused the attention on delamination between the layers due to brittle or fatigue thermally induced crack propagations. The statically indeterminate stress analysis is solved coupling equilibrium, compatibility and constitutive equations. Fracture analysis is based on the classical Griffith's criterion rewritten for composite structures under thermal loading. As an example, a two-layer prismatic structure is considered, each layer being composed by a different functionally graded material. The solution is particularized for the case of a linear grading. The size and shape effects are discussed and an optimization procedure is proposed.

abstract = {In the present work the acoustic emission (AE) technique is applied to examine some aspects influencing concrete failure in compression. By monitoring a structure by means of the AE technique, it proves possible to detect the occurrence of stress-induced cracks. Cracking, in fact, is accompanied by the emission of elastic waves that propagate within the bulk of the material. These waves can be received and recorded by transducers applied to the surface of the structural elements. This technique can be used for diagnosing structural damage phenomena. The current paper presents a mixed experimental and theoretical approach to evaluate the energy density dissipated during compression at each value of strain. Through this method, the two semi-empirical Gutenberg-Richter (GR) laws, well-known in seismology, are verified, the fractal interpretation results of which are very close to the essence of the AE phenomenon, Furthermore, the mentioned approach allows the parameter of 'magnitude' to be identified, appearing in the laws, with the number of oscillations larger than a given threshold measured in volts. Finally, the developed concepts are applied to the study of the compression phenomenon. In particular, by this approach, it is possible to distinguish between the energy progressively dissipated or stored in a compressed structural element.},

In contrast to the assumption of a fixed power exponent p (assumed by West et al. to be equal to 3/4), we propose in this paper a dynamic evolution of p, using experimental data from the cancer literature. In analogy with results obtained by applying scaling laws to the study of fragmentation of solids, the dynamic behaviour of p is related to the evolution of the fractal topology of neoplastic vascular systems. Our model might be applied for diagnostic purposes to mark the emergence of an efficient neo-angiogenetic structure if the results of our in silico experiments are confirmed by clinical observations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction: Adaptation of bone to different loads has received much attention. This paper examines the consequences of differences in size on bones from the same animal species. Methods: The study was conducted on 32 canine radii. Their geometry, densitometry and mechanical properties were determined and one-way ANOVA was used to analyze their distribution by sex. Bending failure was observed during the mechanical test. The bones were then likened to thin beams and the mechanical parameters of interest were appraised via beam theory. A multiple linear regression model with stepwise analyses was employed to determine which parameters rule the mechanical characteristics. The relationships between the bone mass and the parameters investigated were analyzed by means of a model II regression in order to state how the scaling of the bone characteristics act on its mechanical behavior. Results: The linear regression model demonstrated that an animal's mass, its sex and the mineral content and the geometrical properties of its bones almost entirely predict their mechanical behavior. A close fit was found between the experimentally determined and the theoretical slopes of the log regressed allometric equations. The work to failure was found to scale almost linearly with the animal and bone mass and the macroscopical bone material properties were found to be mass invariant. The allometric equations showed that as the animal mass increases, employing proportionally the same amount of tissue, bones get proportionally shorter and proportionally distribute their tissue further from the cross-sectional centroid. Conclusions: Our results suggest that dimensional analysis on the assumption of geometrical self-similarity and mechanical testing according to classic elastic solutions are reasonable in bones tested in accordance to our set up. The bone geometry is the parameter able to curb the energy effects of an animal mass increase. The allometric scaling of the bone length and the cross-sectional layout, without an increase in the amount of material proportionally employed, preserves linear with the animal mass the amount of energy necessary to fracture a bone and restrain the rise of stresses and strains in the cross-section. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The estimation of the harmonic components parameters (amplitudes and phases) is achieved through a signal processing technique based on Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) system, which reveals to be optimal for the specific signal model here considered.

abstract = {In this paper we present a statistical analogy between the collapse of solids and living organisms; in particular we deduce a statistical law governing their probability of death. We have derived such a law coupling the widely used Weibull Statistics, developed for describing the distribution of the strength of solids, with a general model for ontogenetic growth recently proposed in literature. The main idea presented in this paper is that cracks can propagate in solids and cause their failure as sick cells in living organisms can cause their death. Making a rough analogy, living organisms are found to behave as "growing" mechanical components under cyclic, i.e., fatigue, loadings and composed by a dynamic evolutionary material that, as an ineluctable fate, deteriorates. The implications on biological scaling laws are discussed. As an example, we apply such a Dynamic Weibull Statistics to large data collections on human deaths due to cancer of various types recorded in Italy: a significant agreement is observed. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Spiders can produce cobwebs with high strength to density ratio and surprisingly display self-cleaning, strong and releasable adhesion (like geckos). Nanointerlocking, capillary and van der Waals forces, all potential adhesive mechanisms, are thus discussed, demonstrating the key role played by hierarchy in the design of superhydrophobic, i.e.self-cleaning (dry or wet and enhanced by activating Fakir drops as in lotus leaves) and superadhesive materials. The reversibility of the strong attachment is quantified thanks to an improved nonlinear peeling model including friction, for which the solution in closed form is provided. Thus, mimicking nature, thanks to carbon-nanotube-based technology, we suggest the feasibility of large invisible cables, as well as of self-cleaning, superadhesive and releasable hierarchical smart materials. We found that a man can theoretically be supported by a transparent cable with cross-section of 1cm2 and feasibly, with spider material gloves and boots, could remain attached even to a ceiling: a preliminary step towards a Spiderman suit. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A high strength reduction due to voids as large as few atoms is observed. Such results have been included in two analytical failure criteria, namely, the average stress criterion and the point stress criterion. Both models introduce a length scale typical of the system, tailored at describing the process zone near the nanovoids.

abstract = {Criteria assuming that failure of quasi-brittle materials is affected by the stresses acting over a finite distance from the crack tip are widely used inside the scientific community. For instance, they have been applied to predict the failure load of specimens containing sharp V-notches, assuming as a critical parameter the average stress ahead the notch tip. However, this kind of approaches disregards energy balance considerations, which, as well known, are the basis of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). In order to overcome these drawbacks, the present paper uses a recently introduced finite fracture mechanics (FFM) criterion, i.e. a fracture criterion assuming that crack grows by finite steps. The length of this finite extension is determined by a condition of consistency of both energy and stress requirements; as a consequence, the crack advancement is not a material constant but a structural parameter. The criterion is applied to structures with sharp V-notches. The expression of the generalized fracture toughness, which is a function of material tensile strength, fracture toughness and notch opening angle, is given analytically. Finally, we provide comparisons with: (i) the experimental data we obtained from testing Polystyrene specimens under three point bending; (ii) some experimental data available in the literature. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is generally satisfactory and, for most of the cases analyzed, the FFM predictions are better than the ones provided by the simple average stress approach. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cancer growth models may be divided into macroscopic models, which describe the tumor as a single entity, and microscopic ones, which consider the tumor as a complex system whose behavior emerges from the local dynamics of its basic components, the neoplastic cells. Mesoscopic models (e.g. as based on the Local Interaction Simulation Approach [Delsanto, P.P., Mignogna, R., Scalerandi, M., Schechter, R., 1998. In: Delsanto, P.P. Saenz, A.W. (Eds.), New Perspectives on Problems in Classical and Quantum Physics, vol. 2. Gordon & Breach, New Delhi, p. 5174]), which explicitly consider the behavior of cell clusters and their interactions, may be used instead of the microscopic ones, in order to study the properties of cancer biology that strongly depend on the interactions of small groups of cells at intermediate spatial and temporal scales. All these approaches have been developed independently, which limits their usefulness, since they all include relevant features and information that should be cross-correlated for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved. In this contribution we consider multicellular tumor spheroids as biological reference systems and propose an intermediate model to bridge the gap between a macroscopic formulation of tumor growth and a mesoscopic one. Thus we are able to establish, as an important result of our formalism, a direct correspondence between parameters characterizing processes occurring at different scales. In particular, we analyze their dependence on an important limiting factor to tumor growth, i.e. the extra-cellular matrix pressure. Since the macro and meso-models stem from totally different roots (energy conservation and clinical observations vs. cell groups dynamics), their consistency may be used to validate both approaches. It may also be interesting to note that the proposed formalism fits well into a recently proposed conjecture of growth laws universality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The existence of and the conditions for activating and controlling a super-adhesive state are addressed. Even if such a state has never been observed in nanovectors, our calculations, as well as observations in spiders and geckos, suggest its existence and feasible control. Control of the competition between the drag and the adhesive force is exploited to improve the targeting ability and a hierarchical model is applied to describe a real vasculature. The high flexibility of the nanovector is used to smartly deliver the drug only during adhesion by nanopumping or, as a limiting case, by the new concept of 'adhesion induced nanovector implosion'; a liquid drop analogy is utilized for the calculations. Fast (pumping) and slow (diffusion) drug deliveries can thus be separately controlled by controlling the size and shape of the nanovector.

No best-fit parameters are present in the multiscale simulations: the input at level 1 is directly estimated from nanotensile tests of CNTs, whereas its output is considered as the input for the level 2, and so on up to level 5, corresponding to the megacable.

abstract = {In this paper the new concept of 'super-bridges', i.e. kilometre-long bridges suspended over carbon nanotube cables, is introduced. The analysis shows that the use of realistic (thus defective) carbon nanotube bundles as suspension cables can enlarge the current limit main span by a factor of ∼3. Too large compliance and dynamic self-excited resonances could be avoided by additional strands, rendering the super-bridge anchored as a spider's cobweb. As an example, we have computed the limit main spans of the current existing 19 suspended-deck bridges longer than 1 km assuming them to have substituted their cables with carbon nanotube bundles (thus maintaining the same geometry, with the exception of the length) finding spans of up to ∼6.3 km. We thus suggest that the design of the Messina bridge in Italy, which would require a main span of ∼3.3 km, could benefit from the use of carbon nanotube bundles. We believe that their use represents a feasible and economically convenient solution. The plausibility of these affirmations is confirmed by a statistical analysis of the existing 100 longest suspended bridges, which follow a Zipf's law with an exponent of 1.1615: we have found a Moore-like (i.e. exponential) law, in which the doubling of the capacity (here the main span) per year is substituted by the factor 1.0138. Such a law predicts that the realization of the Messina bridge using conventional materials will only occur around the middle of the present century, whereas it could be expected in the near future if carbon nanotube bundles were used. A simple cost analysis concludes the paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Based on energetic considerations, a system evolution equation is derived for a generic damage indicator describing a material system subjected to an increasing external stress. The latter is found to fit into the framework of a recently developed phenomenological universality (PUN) approach and, more specifically, the so-called U2 class. Analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations based on a fiber-bundle model and statistically assigned local strengths at the microscale. The fits with numerical data prove, with an excellent degree of reliability, that the typical evolution of the damage indicator belongs to the aforementioned PUN class.

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation is presently not that widespread for the study of mechanical properties of materials at the nanoscale. " Nanoindenter " machines have greater accuracy and are presently more standardized. However, AFM could provide interesting features such as imaging the indentation impression right after the application of load. The AFM has, in fact, become an increasingly popular tool for characterizing surfaces and thin films of many different types of materials and recent developments have led to the utilization of the AFM as a nanoindentation device, increasing the accuracy of this machine. In this work a new method for nanoindentation via AFM is proposed. It allows hardness mea-surement with standard sharp AFM probes and a simultaneous high-resolution imaging (which is not achievable with standard indenters – Cube Corner and Berkovich). How the shape of the indenter and the tip radius of curvature affect the hardness measurement at the nanoscale is herein analyzed with three different approaches: experiments, numerical simulations, and theo-retical models. In particular the effect of the tip radius of curvature, which is not negligible for the real indenters, has been considered both in the nature of the indentation process, and in the practice of imaging via AFM. A complete theoretical model has been developed and it includes the effect of the tip radius of curvature as well as the variable corner angle. Through this model we have been able to define a correction factor C that permits us to evaluate the actual hardness of the material, once measured the actual geometry of the tip.},

abstract = {To simulate the perfect single-walled boron nitride nanotubes and nanoarches with armchair- and zigzag-type chiralities and uniform diameter of ∼5 nm, we have constructed their one-dimensional (1D) periodic models. In this study, we have compared the calculated properties of nanotubes with those for both hexagonal and cubic phases of bulk: bond lengths, binding energies per B-N bond, effective atomic charges as well as parameters of total and projected one-electron densities of states. For both phases of BN bulk, we have additionally verified their lattice constants. In the density functional theory (DFT), calculations performed using formalism of the localized Gaussian-type atomic functions as implemented in the CRYSTAL-06 code we have applied Hamiltonians containing either PWGGA or hybrid (DFT+HF) B3PW exchange-correlation functionals. After calculation of Hessian matrix for the optimized structures of BN bulk (both phases) and nanotubes (both chiralities) using the CRYSTAL code we have estimated their normal phonon modes within the harmonic approximation. Applying both atomistic and continuum models we have calculated the elastic energies and moduli for SW BN nanoarches. Our calculations clearly show a reproducibility of the atomic structure, effective charges and total energy, as well as phonon and elastic properties when using either PWGGA or hybrid B3PW Hamiltonians. On other hand, there is a high sensitivity of the discrete energy spectra parameters (including band gap) to the choice of the first principles approach (the hybrid method reproduce them noticeably better). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aim of this paper is to present a new fractal approach linking the macroscopic mechanical properties of micro- and nano-structured materials with the main parameters: composition, grain size and structural dimension, as well as contiguity and mean free path. Assuming the key role played by the interfaces, the proposed fractal energy approach unifies the influences of all the above parameters, through the introduction of a fractal structural parameter (FSP), which represents an extension of the Gurland's structural parameter. This modeling approach is assessed through an extensive comparison with experimental data on poly crystalline diamond (PCD) and WC-Co alloys. The results clearly show that the theoretical fractal predictions are in a fairly good agreement with the experiments on both hardness and toughness. This new synthetic parameter is thus proposed to investigate, design and optimize new micro- and nano-grained materials. Eventually, FSP-based optimization maps are developed, that allow to design new materials with high hardness and toughness. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All the specimens broke at the defect, as expected because of the material brittleness and, hence, the generalized stress intensity factor was expected to be the governing failure parameter. Recorded failure loads are then compared with the predictions provided by a fracture criterion recently introduced in the framework of Finite Fracture Mechanics: fracture is assumed to propagate by finite steps, whose length is determined by the contemporaneous fulfilment of energy balance and stress requirements. This fracture criterion allows us to achieve the expression of the generalized fracture toughness as a function of the tensile strength, the fracture toughness and the notch opening angle.

abstract = {In the present paper we analyse the edge debonding failure of a beam strengthened by a fibre reinforced polymer. As well known from the literature, a stress concentration is found at the edge of the reinforcement which triggers the debonding of the fibre reinforced polymer strip when the load reaches a certain critical threshold. Two failure criteria are proposed to study the debonding mechanism. The former is a stress assessment criterion, i.e. failure takes place whenever the maximum shearing stress reaches a limit value (the interfacial bond strength). The latter is an energy, fracture mechanics criterion, i.e. failure takes place as the strain energy release rate reaches a critical value (the interfacial fracture energy). It is argued that the energy criterion is more effective to address the edge debonding failure mode. However, under the assumption of shear lag behaviour for the adhesive layer between the beam and the reinforcement, a general rule linking the two approaches is set, thus providing the key to bypass the rather complicated energetic analysis. The final part of the paper is devoted to the crack instabilities that may occur after the debonding initiates, i.e. snap-back and snap-through phenomena. The size effect is then investigated by means of a dimensional analysis and a simplified formula providing the critical load is proposed that could be useful in engineering practice. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Laser surface texturing is often employed to improve tribological performances of mating surfaces. The principal aim of the present work is to study local modifications induced by laser beam during the texturing process (microdimpling), on the mechanical properties of a 30NiCrMo12 nitride steel. A brief tribological characterization was initially made in order to verify the improvement of tribological behaviour ensured by microdimpling. Friction measurements were carried out in lubricated flat-on-flat and round-on-flat configurations. A sub-surface characterization was performed by focused ion beam cross-section and imaging. Modified material layers were discovered in correspondence of laser-affected zones around dimples, where grain dimensions were observed to be reduced. To quantify this phenomenon, a new theoretical energetic model was developed. Hardness measurements were performed by atomic force microscope nanoindentation. This approach allowed to observe an hardening effect moving from bulk material to dimple edges. Therefore, the theoretical model was integrated with the Hall-Petch's law in order to quantify the observed hardening behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we show that such invisible cables could in principle be built, thanks to carbon nanotube bundles. Theoretical strength of ∼10 MPa, Young's modulus of ∼0.1 GPa and density of ∼0.1 Kg/m3 are estimated. The theoretical strength over density ratio is huge, i.e. that of a single carbon nanotube; the strength of a real, thus defective, invisible cable is estimated to be ∼1 MPa. Finally, we demonstrate that such cables can be easily transported in their visible state (with bunched nanotubes) and that an efficient anti-bunching controllable mechanism, involving pressure of $\sim$1 Pa, can control the visible-invisible transition, and vice versa. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The determination of the failure load for brittle or quasi-brittle specimens containing a re-entrant corner has been faced by several authors, whose approaches are available in the Scientific Literature. However, up to now, little attention has been paid to the presence of a minimum, i.e. an angle at which the critical load attains its minimum value. Even if the minimum was detected in several experiments, it was not highlighted or it was considered as a mere consequence of the scattering of experimental data. Restricting the analysis to a sharp V-notched infinite slab under a remote tensile load, the problem is fully investigated in this paper. It is shown that a minimum, more or less pronounced according to the brittleness number, is always present. It means that the edge crack is not the most dangerous configuration, although the notch opening angle providing the minimum failure load tends to vanish for large notch depths as well as for very brittle materials. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Biological materials such as spider silk display hierarchical structures, from nano to macro, effectively linking nanoscale constituents to larger-scale functional material properties. Here, we develop a model that is capable of determining the strength and toughness of elastic-plastic composites from the properties, percentages, and arrangement of its constituents, and of estimating the corresponding dissipated energy during damage progression, in crack-opening control. Specifically, we adopt a fiber bundle model approach with a hierarchical multiscale self-similar procedure which enables to span various orders of magnitude in size and to explicitly take into account the hierarchical topology of natural materials. Hierarchical architectures and self-consistent energy dissipation mechanisms (including plasticity), both omitted in common fiber bundle models, are fully considered in our model. By considering one of the toughest known materials today as an example application, a synthetic fiber composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinyl alcohol gel, we compute strength and specific energy absorption values that are consistent with those experimentally observed. Our calculations are capable of predicting these values solely based on the properties of the constituent materials and knowledge of the structural multiscale topology. Due to the crack-opening control nature of the simulations, it is also possible to derive a critical minimal percentage of plastic component needed to avoid catastrophic behavior of the material. These results suggest that the model is capable of helping in the design of new supertough materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An in situ electron microscopy study is presented of adhesion interactions between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by mechanically peeling thin free-standing SWNT bundles using in situ nanomanipulation techniques inside a high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The in situ measurements clearly reveal the process of delaminating one SWNT bundle from its originally bound SWNT bundle in a controlleddisplacement manner and capture the deformation curvature of the delaminated SWNT bundle during the peeling process. A theoretical model based on nonlinear el{\'{a}}stica theory is employed to interpret the measured deformation curvatures of the SWNTs and to quantitatively evaluate the peeling force and the adhesion strength between bundled SWNTs. The estimated adhesion energy per unit length for each pair of neighboring tubes in the peeling interface based on our peeling experiments agrees reasonably well with the theoretical value. This in situ peeling technique provides a potential new method for separating bundled SWNTs without compromising their material properties. The combined peeling experiments and modeling presented in this paper will be very useful to the study of the adhesion interactions between SWNTs and their nonlinear mechanical behaviors in the large-displacement regime. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fundamental description, understanding and regulation of such materials will ultimately lead to a new generation of integrated systems that utilize their unique properties. In this review, we describe some of the recent advances in theoretical investigation on structural and dynamical behavior of CNS, as well as relevant simulation techniques. Theoretically it has been found that a stable equilibrium core size of CNS can be uniquely determined or tuned from the basal graphene length, the interlayer spacing, the interaction energy between layers of CNS and the bending stiffness of graphene. Perturbations of the surface energy, which can be controlled by an electric field, will cause a CNS to undergo breathing oscillatory motion as well as translational rolling motion on a substrate. The tunable core size of CNS also enables it to serve potentially as transmembrane water channels in biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.},

abstract = {Spider dragline silk is one of the strongest, most extensible and toughest biological materials known, exceeding the properties of many engineered materials including steel. Silk features a hierarchical architecture where highly organized, densely H-bonded beta-sheet nanocrystals are arranged within a semiamorphous protein matrix consisting of 31-helices and beta-turn protein structures. By using a bottom-up molecular-based approach, here we develop the first spider silk mesoscale model, bridging the scales from Angstroms to tens to potentially hundreds of nanometers. We demonstrate that the specific nanoscale combination of a crystalline phase and a semiamorphous matrix is crucial to achieve the unique properties of silks. Our results reveal that the superior mechanical properties of spider silk can be explained solely by structural effects, where the geometric confinement of beta-sheet nanocrystals, combined with highly extensible semiamorphous domains, is the key to reach great strength and great toughness, despite the dominance of mechanically inferior chemical interactions such as H-bonding. Our model directly shows that semiamorphous regions govern the silk behavior at small deformation, unraveling first when silk is being stretched and leading to the large extensibility of the material. Conversely, beta-sheet nanocrystals play a significant role in defining the mechanical behavior of silk at large-deformation. In particular, the ultimate tensile strength of silk is controlled by the strength of beta-sheet nanocrystals, which is directly related to their size, where small beta-sheet nanocrystals are crucial to reach outstanding levels of strength and toughness. Our results and mechanistic insight directly explain recent experimental results, where it was shown that a significant change in the strength and toughness of silk can be achieved solely by tuning the size of beta-sheet nanocrystals. Our findings help to unveil the material design strategy that enables silk to achieve superior material performance despite simple and inferior material constituents. This concept could lead to a new materials design paradigm, where enhanced functionality is not achieved using complex building blocks but rather through the utilization of simple repetitive constitutive elements arranged in hierarchical structures from nano to macro. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper we derive the theory of multiple peeling, extending the pioneering energy-based single peeling theory of Kendall, including large deformations and pre-stretching. We can thus treat a complex system of films, adhering over a substrate and having a common hinge where the pulling force is applied. Two case studies are investigated: the asymmetric V-shape double peeling and the symmetric cone-shape configuration with N peeling tapes, both requiring the solution of six nonlinear coupled equations (instead of the one needed in the simpler single peeling problem). Remarkable implications emerge: (1) for moderate deformations, the critical strain of a tape is identical to that of the single peeling; (2) an optimal peeling angle, at which adhesion is maximal, is discovered; (3) an additional optimization, even for hierarchical structures, is introduced by imposing the delamination force equal to the intrinsic fracture of the tape. Also, the length of the peeling process zone is calculated, suggesting different optimal values for flaw-tolerant peeling at different angles. Applications to gecko adhesion, for which the flaw-tolerant peeling is demonstrated, and spider silk anchors, that we are going to discuss in details in subsequent papers, are envisioned (including a new pre-stretching mechanism for adhesion control) and suggested by the evidence of a smart mechanism capable of maximizing adhesion simply by increasing the applied tension. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Biology implements intriguing structural design principles that allow for attractive mechanical properties-such as high strength, toughness, and extensibility despite being made of weak and brittle constituents, as observed in biomineralized structures. For example, diatom algae contain nanoporous hierarchical silicified shells, called frustules, which provide mechanical protection from predators and virus penetration. These frustules generally have a morphology resembling honeycombs within honeycombs, meshes, or wavy shapes, and are surprisingly tough when compared to bulk silica, which is one of the most brittle materials known. However, the reason for its extreme extensibility has not been explained from a molecular level upwards. By carrying out a series of molecular dynamics simulations with the first principles-based reactive force field ReaxFF, the mechanical response of the structures is elucidated and correlated with underlying deformation mechanisms. Specifically, it is shown that for wavy silica, unfolding mechanisms are achieved for increasing amplitude and allow for greater ductility of up to 270% strain. This mechanism is reminiscent to the uncoiling of hidden length from proteins that allows for enhanced energy dissipation capacity and, as a result, toughness. We report the development of an analytical continuum model that captures the results from atomistic simulations and can be used in multiscale models to bridge to larger scales. Our results demonstrate that tuning the geometric parameters of amplitude and width in wavy silica nanostructures are beneficial in improving the mechanical properties, including enhanced deformability, effectively overcoming the intrinsic shortcomings of the base material that features extreme brittleness.

The paper reports a study of distribution and morphology, as a function of silver thickness, deposition conditions and etching times. The application of polystyrene soft masks obtained by self-assembly and the sputter-etching by Ar ions allow the formation of regular indentations in the silver thin films, giving origin to a regular distribution of extruded pillars and wires during the following etching in HF:H 2O 2:H 2O. The aqueous etching and the use of silver still influence the homogeneity of the etching result on large area and introduce a modulation in the etching front, so affecting thickness homogeneity.

abstract = {Silk is an exceptionally strong, extensible, and tough material made from simple protein building blocks. The molecular structure of dragline spider silk repeat units consists of semiamorphous and nanocrystalline $\beta$-sheet protein domains. Here we show by a series of computational experiments how the nanoscale properties of silk repeat units are scaled up to create macroscopic silk fibers with outstanding mechanical properties despite the presence of cavities, tears, and cracks. We demonstrate that the geometric confinement of silk fibrils to diameters of 50 ± 30 nm is critical to facilitate a powerful mechanism by which hundreds of thousands of protein domains synergistically resist deformation and failure to provide enhanced strength, extensibility, and toughness at the macroscale, closely matching experimentally measured mechanical properties. Through this mechanism silk fibers exploit the full potential of the nanoscale building blocks, regardless of the details of microscopic loading conditions and despite the presence of large defects. Experimental results confirm that silk fibers are composed of silk fibril bundles with diameters in the range of 20-150 nm, in agreement with our predicted length scale. Our study reveals a general mechanism to map nanoscale properties to the macroscale and provides a potent design strategy toward novel fiber and bulk nanomaterials through hierarchical structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Many biological attachment devices of insects, spiders and geckos consist of arrays of hairs (setae), which are terminated by contact elements of different shapes. However, the most frequently observed shape is a thin plate-like spatula. In spite of a rather wide range of sizes, most spatulae of different animals are not uniform, but rather possess a gradient in thickness and width. Here we show that the spatulae of insects and geckos become gradually thinner and wider approaching the end. This geometrical effect is explained in the present paper, by using a numerical approach for the modelling of the van der Waals adhesion and friction between the contact elements and the substrate. The approach suggests that the observed negative thickness gradient contributes to the improvement of the adhesion resistance, whereas the positive width gradient increases the stability of the detachment, probably a key factor in controlling the animal walking. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We characterized the water sliding behavior by measuring the contact angle (CA), sliding angle, sliding volume, and sliding speed (SS) of the lotus leaf (CA = 153.4°, SS = 319.4 mm/s), copied lotus leaf, negative silicone template, flat silicone and PS control surfaces, and final PS artificial leaf (CA = 149.0°, SS = 416.7 mm/s); the last one displays properties comparable with those of lotus. This template method needs neither expensive instruments nor complicated chemical treatments. An adequate optimization of this molding process into automated industrial procedures will lead to a new, innovative, cheap concept for the large-scale industrial development of superhydrophobic surfaces, also starting from their intrinsically hydrophilic counterparts, as here demonstrated for PS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This experimental work is oriented to give a contribution to the knowledge of the relationship among surface roughness parameters and tribological properties of lubricated surfaces; it is well known that these surface properties are strictly related, but a complete comprehension of such correlations is still far to be reached. For this purpose, a mechanical polishing procedure was optimized in order to induce different, but well controlled, morphologies on Si(100) surfaces. The use of different abrasive papers and slurries enabled the formation of a wide spectrum of topographical irregularities (from the submicro-to the nano-scale) and a broad range of surface profiles. An AFM-based morphological and topographical campaign was carried out to characterize each silicon rough surface through a set of parameters. Samples were subsequently water lubricated and tribologically characterized through ball-on-disk tribometer measurements. Indeed, the wettability of each surface was investigated by measuring the water droplet contact angle, that revealed a hydrophilic character for all the surfaces, even if no clear correlation with roughness emerged. Nevertheless, this observation brings input to the purpose, as it allows to exclude that the differences in surface profile affect lubrication. So it is possible to link the dynamic friction coefficient of rough Si samples exclusively to the opportune set of surface roughness parameters that can exhaustively describe both height amplitude variations (R a, R dq) and profile periodicity (R sk, R ku, l c) that influence asperity-asperity interactions and hydrodynamic lift in different ways. For this main reason they cannot be treated separately, but with dependent approach through which it was possible to explain even counter intuitive results: the unexpected decreasing of friction coefficient with increasing R a is justifiable by a more consistent increasing of kurtosis R ku.

abstract = {Spider silks display generally strong mechanical properties, even if differences between species and within the same species can be observed. While many different types of silks have been tested, the mechanical properties of stalks of silk taken from the egg sac of the cave spider Meta menardi have not yet been analyzed. Meta menardi has recently been chosen as the "European spider of the year 2012", from the European Society of Arachnology. Here we report a study where silk stalks were collected directly from several caves in the north-west of Italy. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images showed that stalks are made up of a large number of threads, each of them with diameter of 6.03±0.58 $\mu$m. The stalks were strained at the constant rate of 2 mm/min, using a tensile testing machine. The observed maximum stress, strain and toughness modulus, defined as the area under the stress-strain curve, are 0.64 GPa, 751% and 130.7 MJ/m 3, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, such an observed huge elongation has never been reported for egg sac silk stalks and suggests a huge unrolling microscopic mechanism of the macroscopic stalk that, as a continuation of the protective egg sac, is expected to be composed by fibres very densely and randomly packed. The Weibull statistics was used to analyze the results from mechanical testing, and an average value of Weibull modulus (m) is deduced to be in the range of 1.5-1.8 with a Weibull scale parameter ($\sigma$ 0) in the range of 0.33-0.41 GPa, showing a high coefficient of correlation (R 2 = 0.97). {\textcopyright} 2012 Lepore et al.},

Few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes with less than ten layers each show a distinctive band structure. Thus, there is an increasing interest in the physics and applications of FLGs. Raman spectroscopy is one of the most useful and versatile tools to probe graphene samples. Here, we uncover the interlayer shear mode of FLGs, ranging from bilayer graphene (BLG) to bulk graphite, and suggest that the corresponding Raman peak measures the interlayer coupling. This peak scales from ∼43cm-1 in bulk graphite to ∼31cm-1 in BLG. Its low energy makes it sensitive to near-Dirac point quasiparticles. Similar shear modes are expected in all layered materials, providing a direct probe of interlayer interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Natural materials are renowned for exquisite designs that optimize function, as illustrated by the elasticity of blood vessels, the toughness of bone and the protection offered by nacre. Particularly intriguing are spider silks, with studies having explored properties ranging from their protein sequence to the geometry of a web. This material system, highly adapted to meet a spiders many needs, has superior mechanical properties. In spite of much research into the molecular design underpinning the outstanding performance of silk fibres, and into the mechanical characteristics of web-like structures, it remains unknown how the mechanical characteristics of spider silk contribute to the integrity and performance of a spider web. Here we report web deformation experiments and simulations that identify the nonlinear response of silk threads to stress-involving softening at a yield point and substantial stiffening at large strain until failure-as being crucial to localize load-induced deformation and resulting in mechanically robust spider webs. Control simulations confirmed that a nonlinear stress response results in superior resistance to structural defects in the web compared to linear elastic or elastic-plastic (softening) material behaviour. We also show that under distributed loads, such as those exerted by wind, the stiff behaviour of silk under small deformation, before the yield point, is essential in maintaining the webs structural integrity. The superior performance of silk in webs is therefore not due merely to its exceptional ultimate strength and strain, but arises from the nonlinear response of silk threads to strain and their geometrical arrangement in a web. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {In the present article, nonlinear free and forced vibration of a bilayer graphene embedded in a polymer medium is studied based on the nonlocal elasticity theory. As a nonlinear function of deflection of graphene sheets, a refined pressure expression is established to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between graphene layers and polymer medium. Assuming the large displacements and anisotropic model for graphene layers, the nonlinear couple partial differential equations of a double layered graphene sheet (DLGS) are obtained. The in-phase and out of phase nonlinear to linear natural frequencies are shown for both zigzag and armchair geometries. The effects of small scale parameter, nonlinear coefficients of vdW between two layers, nonlinear factor of polymer matrix and geometric properties on the nonlinear vibrational behavior of a DLGS are discussed in detail. It is found that the nonlinear vdW coefficient has a significant effect on the out of phase frequencies while the nonlinear polymer coefficient has considerable influence on in-phase frequencies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Finally, parametric analyses reveal influences of some key parameters on the local buckling stress and strength-to-density ratio; meanwhile the constitutive behaviors and energy-absorption properties, with increasing hierarchy n, are calculated.

abstract = {Natural materials are often organized in complex hierarchical architectures to optimize mechanical properties. Artificial bio-inspired materials, however, have thus far failed to successfully mimic how these architectures improve material characteristics, for example strength. Here, a method is proposed for evaluating the role of hierarchy on structural strength. To do this, we consider different hierarchical architectures of fiber bundles through analytical multiscale calculations based on a fiber bundle model at each hierarchical level. In general, we find that an increase in the number of hierarchy levels leads to a decrease in the strength of material. However, when a composite bundle with two different types of fibers is considered, an improvement in the mean strength is obtained for some specific hierarchical architectures, indicating that both hierarchy and material "mixing" are necessary ingredients to obtain improved mechanical properties. Results are promising for the improvement and "tuning" of the strength of bio-inspired materials. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The scratching resistance and hardness are then discussed as a function of the penetration velocity.

The nonlinear elastic properties of graphene and its exceptional intrinsic strength, with mean Young's modulus of 1TPa, third-order elastic stiffness of -2.0TPa and intrinsic strength of 130GPa, are drawn from recent experimental studies. The model allows to derive macroscopic characteristics like strength, stiffness, toughness as a function of hierarchical structure, starting from statistically distributed properties at the nanoscale and without the introduction of additional ad hoc parameters.

abstract = {It is well known that hierarchical structure is an important feature in biological materials to optimise various properties, including mechanical ones. It is however still unclear how these hierarchical architectures can improve material characteristics, for example strength. Also, the transposition of these structures from natural to artificial bioinspired materials remains to be perfected. In this paper, we introduce a numerical method to evaluate the strength of fibre-based heterogeneous biological materials and systematically investigate the role of hierarchy. Results show that hierarchy indeed plays an important role and that it is possible to "tune" the strength of bio-inspired materials in a wide range of values, in some cases improving the strength of non-hierarchical structures considerably. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The shear failure and friction mechanisms of bioinspired adhesives consisting of elastomer arrays of microfibres terminated by mushroom-shaped tips are investigated in contact with a rigid lens. In order to reveal the interplay between the vertical and lateral loading directions, experiments are carried out using a custom friction set-up in which normal stiffness can be made either high or low when compared with the stiffness of the contact between the fibrillar adhesive and the lens. Using in situ contact imaging, the shear failure of the adhesive is found to involve two successive mechanisms: (i) cavitation and peeling at the contact interface between the mushroomshaped fibre tip endings and the lens; and (ii) side re-adhesion of the fibre's stem to the lens. The extent of these mechanisms and their implications regarding static friction forces is found to depend on the crosstalk between the normal and lateral loading directions that can result in contactinstabilities associated with fibre buckling. In addition, the effects of the viscoelastic behaviour of the polyurethane material on the ratedependence of the shear response of the adhesive are accounted for. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Although it is known that the degree of crumpling affects graphene's properties and the performance of graphene-based devices and materials3,5,7, the controlled folding and unfolding of crumpled graphene films has not been demonstrated. Here we report an approach to reversibly control the crumpling and unfolding of large-area graphene sheets. We show with experiments, atomistic simulations and theory that, by harnessing the mechanical instabilities of graphene adhered on a biaxially pre-stretched polymer substrate and by controlling the relaxation of the pre-strains in a particular order, graphene films can be crumpled into tailored self-organized hierarchical structures that mimic superhydrophobic leaves. The approach enables us to fabricate large-area conductive coatings and electrodes showing superhydrophobicity, high transparency, and tunable wettability and transmittance. We also demonstrate that crumpled graphene-polymer laminates can be used as artificial-muscle actuators. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new approach based on the concepts of quantized fracture mechanics (QFM) is presented and discussed in this paper to estimate the bonding strength of trabecular-like coatings, i.e. glass-ceramic scaffolds mimicking the architecture of cancellous bone, to ceramic substrates. The innovative application of glass-derived scaffolds as trabecular-like coatings is proposed in order to enhance the osteointegration of prosthetic ceramic devices. The scaffolds, prepared by polymeric sponge replication, are joined to alumina substrates by a dense glass-ceramic coating (interlayer) and the so-obtained 3-layer constructs are investigated from micro-structural, morphological and mechanical viewpoints. In particular, the fracture strengths of three different crack propagation modes, i.e. glass-derived scaffold fracture, interface delamination or mixed fracture, are predicted in agreement with those of experimental mechanical tests. The approach proposed in this work could have interesting applications towards an ever more rational design of bone tissue engineering biomaterials and coatings, in view of the optimization of their mechanical properties for making them actually suitable for clinical applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, a new kind of hierarchical tube with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first level tube is constructed by rolling up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second level tube is produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first level tube and rolling it up. The Nth (N ≥ 1) level tube can be built recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all levels of the NPR hierarchical tubes expand in the transverse direction. Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism, strength and toughness.

The longest jumps are observed when the higher friction occurs, that in turn happens when the average particle diameter of each substratum is comparable to the insect's claw diameter. In the longest jump, the cricket A. domesticus was propelled forwards for almost 30cm, about 16 times its body length, to a take-off velocity of 1.8m/s at an angle of 36.9° with a kinetic energy of 520$\mu$J, in agreement with previously published studies where the role of friction was not elucidated. In addition, the crickets' legs were also strained at the constant rate of 1mm/min, using a tensile testing machine. The observed maximum stress, strain and toughness modulus, defined as the area under the stress-strain curve, are 69.4MPa, 17.4% and 0.72MJ/m3, respectively, and are compatible with the required jumping performances. Finally, we compare the jumping performances of A. domesticus with other jumping insects, such as locusts, planthoppers, froghoppers, bush crickets, pygmy mole crickets, false stick insects and stick insects, which were analysed in previously published papers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The mechanism of detachment of thin films from a flat smooth rigid substrate is investigated. In particular, analytical solutions in closed form are proposed for the double peeling of an elastic tape as well as for the axisymmetric peeling of a membrane. We show that in the case of double peeling of an endless elastic tape, a critical value of the pull-off force is found, above which the tape is completely detached from the substrate. In particular, as the detachment process advances, the peeling angle is stabilized on a limiting value, which only depends on the geometry of the tape, its elastic modulus and on the interfacial energy \Updelta\gamma $\Delta$ $\gamma$. This predicted behavior agrees with the "theory of multiple peeling" and clarifies some aspects of this theory. Moreover, it is also corroborated by experimental results (work in progress) we are carrying out on a standard adhesive tape adhered to a smooth flat poly(methyl methacrylate) surface. In the case of the axisymmetric adhering membrane, a different behavior is observed. In such case, the system is always stable, and the detached area monotonically increases with the peeling force, i.e., the elastic membrane can sustain in principle any applied force. Results are validated by a fully numerical analysis performed with the aid of a finite element commercial software. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Millions of years of evolution have adapted spider webs to achieve a range of properties, including the well-known capture of prey, with efficient use of materials. One feature that remains poorly understood is the attachment disc, a network of silk fibers that mechanically anchors a web to its environment. Experimental observations suggest that one possible attachment disc adheres to a substrate through multiple symmetrically branched structures composed of sub-micrometer scale silk fibers. Here, a theoretical model is used to explore the adaptation of the strength of attachment of such an anchorage, and complementary mesoscale simulations are applied to demonstrate a novel mechanism of synergetic material and structural optimization, such that the maximum anchorage strength can be achieved regardless of the initial anchor placement or material type. The optimal delamination (peeling) angle is facilitated by the inherent extensibility of silk, and is attained automatically during the process of delamination. This concept of self-optimizing peeling angle suggests that attachment discs do not require precise placement by the spider, irrespective of adhesion strength. Additional hierarchical branching of the anchorage increases efficiency, where both the delamination force and toughness modulus increase with a splitting of the cross-sectional area. How does a spider attach a web to the environment, in spite of unknown conditions? The answer is the unique attachment disc, a clustered network of piriform silk fibers that mechanically anchors a web. Through integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental analysis, the clever mechanism by which this structure provides a self-optimizing strong and robust attachment is elucidated.

abstract = {The length of nanotubes is a critical structural parameter for the design and manufacture of nanotube-based material systems and devices. High-precision length control of nanotubes by means of mechanical cutting using a scriber has not materialized due to the lack of the knowledge of the appropriate cutting conditions and the tube failure mechanism. In this paper, we present a quantitative nanomechanical study of the cutting of individual boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes. In our nanotube cutting measurements, a nanotube standing still on a flat substrate was laterally scribed by an AFM tip. The tip-tube collision force deformed the tube, and eventually fractured the tube at the collision site by increasing the cutting load. The mechanical response of nanotubes during the tip-tube collision process and the roles of the scribing velocity and the frictional interaction on the tip-tube collision contact in cutting nanotubes were quantitatively investigated by cutting double-walled BNNTs of 2.26-4.28 nm in outer diameter. The fracture strength of BNNTs was also quantified based on the measured collision forces and their structural configurations using contact mechanics theories. Our analysis reports fracture strengths of 9.1-15.5 GPa for the tested BNNTs. The nanomechanical study presented in this paper demonstrates that the AFM-based nanomechanical cutting technique not only enables effective control of the length of nanotubes with high precision, but is also promising as a new nanomechanical testing technique for characterizing the mechanical properties of tubular nanostructures. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The effects of large deformation, initial curvature, discreteness and direction of chiral vector on the bending stiffness of the monolayer graphene are discussed in detail. A behavior more complex than previously reported in the literature emerges. It is found that the bending stiffness of graphene strongly depends on the initial configuration, showing not obvious maxima and minima, and suggesting the possibility of a smart tuning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Compared with triangular, square and Kagome honeycombs, hexagonal honeycomb has superior heat dissipation capabilities, but its lower in-plane stiffness hinders its multifunctional applications. Regarding this problem, in this paper we propose a multifunctional hierarchical honeycomb (MHH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) sub-structures. This MHH is constructed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original regular hexagonal honeycomb (ORHH) with two kinds of equal mass NPR honeycombs, the anisotropic re-entrant honeycomb or the isotropic chiral honeycomb. Based on the Euler beam theory, formulas for the Young's moduli of these two kinds of MHH structures are derived. Results show that by appropriately adjusting the geometrical parameters both the re-entrant honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.045) and the chiral honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.75) can greatly tune the in-plane stiffness of the MHH structure. The presented theory could thus be used in designing new tailorable hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {The shear adhesive force of four non-climbing cockroaches (Blatta orientalis Linnaeus, 1758) was investigated by the use of a centrifugal machine, evaluating the shear safety factor (adhesion force divided by body weight) on six surfaces (steel, aluminium, copper, two sandpapers and a common paper sheet) having different roughness. The adhesive system of Blatta orientalis was characterized by means of a field emission scanning electron microscope and the surface roughness was determined by an atomic force microscope. The cockroach maximum shear safety factor, or apparent friction coefficient, is determined to be 12.1 on the less rough of the two sandpapers, while its minimum value is equal to 1.9 on the steel surface. A two-sample Student t analysis has been conducted in order to evaluate the significance of the differences among the obtained shear safety factors due to both roughness and chemistry. An interesting correlation between cockroach shear adhesion and surface roughness emerges with a threshold mechanism dictated by the competition between claw tip radius and roughness, indicating that the best adhesion is obtained for roughness larger than the claw tip radius. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {At the nanoscale, differently to what happens at the macroscale, friction even without an applied normal pressure and spontaneous adhesion take place. In particular, the nanotribology between two layers of graphene, or other two-dimensional nanomaterials (even curved, such as nanotube walls), remains controversial. It is sufficient to say that friction between two graphene layers or nanotube walls is described in the current literature giving as "material property" a constant friction force or a constant friction shear strength, even if such views are obviously mutually exclusive. Is friction dominated by a strength, by a force or by an energy? Coupling elasticity and energy balance we solve this paradox deriving a generalization of the celebrated Coulomb's friction law, reconciling the two current views. Molecular dynamics simulations on graphene are conducted to verify its validity at the nanoscale whereas statistical simulations confirm its validity even at the macroscale. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The axial deformation of the horizontal cell wall is included, comparing to the Gibson's method, and the contributions of the two components of surface stress (i.e. surface residual stress and surface elasticity) are discussed. The result shows that the regular hexagonal honeycomb is not isotropic but orthotropic. An increase in the cell-wall thickness t leads to an increase in the discrepancy of the Young's moduli in both directions. Furthermore, the surface residual stress dominates the surface effect on the elastic constants when t<15 nm (or the relative density <0.17), which is in contrast to that the surface elasticity does when t>15 nm (or the relative density >0.17) for metal Al. The present structure and theory may be useful in the design of future nanodevices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The influence of key parameters, like interface strength and friction, on ballistic limit is studied. We find that a proper set of interface parameters is able to maximize the specific energy absorption of the panel: although this optimum is variable case by case depending on projectile penetrability and target configuration, general guidelines are provided. Oblique impact results in a higher ballistic limit also thanks to projectile change in trajectory, providing interesting spots for future developments.

abstract = {Millions of years of evolution have adapted spider silks to achieve a range of functions, including the well-known capture of prey, with efficient use of material. From a materials perspective, the exceptional mechanical properties of self-assembling silk biopolymers have been extensively explored, both experimentally and in computational investigations. Yet few studies account for the structural function of silk within the web itself. Recently, a series of investigations have been conducted to examine structure-function relationships across different length scales in silk, ranging from atomistic models of protein constituents to the spider web architecture. Here, through theoretical and computational models, we attempt to reconcile the unique mechanical behavior of spider silk (i.e., material) with the performance of the web itself (i.e., structure), and elucidate the intimate and synergistic relationship between the two – the ultimate merging of material and structure. Particularly, we review recent analyses that considered an entire web structure subject to load, as well as the critical anchorage that secures the web to its (uncertain) environment. Beyond assessment of simple performance, we derive the theoretical basis for the underlying mechanics (through quantized fracture mechanics and the theory of multiple peeling, respectively). As such, the results can be translated to engineered structures in general, beyond the particular case of spider silks and webs. Interestingly, in both cases (web fracture and anchorage failure), the extreme hyperelasticity – i.e. elastic stiffening under large extension – benefits structural performance, in contrast to typical engineering practice (wherein large deformation is typically avoided). The spider web is a highly adapted system where both material and hierarchical structure across all length-scales is critical for its functional properties.},

abstract = {Fragmentation of thin layers of materials is mediated by a network of cracks on its surface. It is commonly seen in dehydrated paintings or asphalt pavements and even in graphene or other two-dimensional materials, but is also observed in the characteristic polygonal pattern on a crocodile's head. Here, we build a simple mechanical model of a thin film and investigate the generation and development of fragmentation patterns as the material is exposed to various modes of deformation. We find that the characteristic size of fragmentation, defined by the mean diameter of polygons, is strictly governed by mechanical properties of the film material. Our result demonstrates that skin fragmentation on the head of crocodiles is dominated by that it features a small ratio between the fracture energy and Young's modulus, and the patterns agree well with experimental observations. Understanding this mechanics-driven process could be applied to improve the lifetime and reliability of thin film coatings by mimicking crocodile skin.},

abstract = {In this work we study the mechanical properties and failure mechanism of nano-composites of graphene oxide sheets embedded in polymeric systems, namely films and electro-spun nanofibers. In this last system, contrary to conventional bulk composites, the size of the nano-reinforcement (GO sheets) is comparable to the size of the nanofibers to be reinforced (≈ 200 nm). As polymeric matrix we use gelatin. We demonstrate that the high chemical affinity of the two materials hinders the renaturation of gelatin into collagen and causes a nearly ideal mixing in the GO-gelatin composite. Adding just 1% of GO (wt of GO with respect to gelatin) we obtain an increase of Young's modulus >50% and an increase of fracture stress >60%. We use numerical simulations to study the failure mechanism of the fibers. Calculations well agree with experimental data and show that, even if cracks start at GO sheet edges due to stress concentrations, crack propagation is hindered by the nonlinear behaviour of the matrix. Moreover, the presence of the GO sheets in continuous gelatin films improves the material stability to phosphate buffer solutions from 2 days to 2 weeks, making it a better material than gelatin for applications in biological environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Millions of years of evolution have adapted spider webs to achieve a range of functionalities, including thewell-known capture of prey, with efficient use of material. One feature that has escaped extensive investigation is the silk-on-silk connection joints within spiderwebs, particularly from a structural mechanics perspective. We report a joint theoretical and computational analysis of an idealized silk-on-silk fibre junction. By modifying the theory of multiple peeling, we quantitatively compare the performance of the system while systematically increasing the rigidity of the anchor thread, by both scaling the stress-strain response and the introduction of an applied pre-strain. The results of our study indicate that compliance is a virtue - the more extensible the anchorage, the tougher and stronger the connection becomes. In consideration of the theoretical model, in comparison with rigid substrates, a compliant anchorage enormously increases the effective adhesion strength (work required to detach), independent of the adhered thread itself, attributed to a nonlinear alignment between thread and anchor (contact peeling angle). The results can direct novel engineering design principles to achieve possible load transfer from compliant fibre-to-fibre anchorages, be they silk-on-silk or another, as-yet undeveloped, system. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Much effort has been spent to understand the link between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic fiber properties. Here we apply a mesoscopic coarse-grained model of the keratin macrofilament fibril combined with an analytical solution based on the concept of entropic hyperelasticity of the protein helix to investigate the link between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic properties of keratin fibers. The mesoscopic model provides good agreement with a wide range of experimental results. Based on the mesoscopic model, the predicted stress-strain curve of hair fibers agrees well with our own experimental measurements. The disulfide crosslink between the microfibril-matrix and matrix-matrix contributes to the initial modulus and provides stiffening at larger deformation of the trichocyte keratin fibers. The results show that the disulfide bonds reinforce the macrofilament and enhance the robustness of the macrofilament by facilitating the microfilaments to deform cooperatively.

abstract = {A necessary condition to include nanoscale materials in the design of high-performing as well as reliable electrical and electromechanical devices is the availability of a sufficiently deep knowledge of their mechanical behavior. Up to date, the most powerful tools for mechanical characterization of nanosamples are properly designed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), due to their compatibility with scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) and high resolution force/displacement measurements. Herein, we report about the design of a MEMS platform for in situ SEM tensile testing of nanoscale samples. This is characterized by a very compact structure, based only on a bent beam electrothermal actuator, which performs both actuating and sensing functions. The size of the structural components of the present device is chosen with the aim of testing ceramic nanowires, but the resulting configuration can be applied also for other material samples. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel porous anisotropic scaffold with hierarchy is proposed for bone regeneration. The scaffold can mimic the morphology and the mechanical anisotropy of the natural bone. In this letter, the pores within the scaffold are prolate spheroidal and the structural anisotropy is controlled by the parameter $\beta$, which denotes the ratio of the semi-major axis to the semi-minor axis of the prolate spheroidal pores. The elastic-plastic behavior of the scaffold is studied for different porosities and $\beta$ values using the finite element method. It has been found that the mechanical anisotropy depends on the parameter $\beta$, where a larger $\beta$ leads to higher mechanical anisotropy. The scaffold's structure is simple and can be achieved easily in manufacturing with controllable porosity and anisotropy. Thus, the scaffold is a promising candidate for bone regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analytically studied the in-plane elastic and transport properties of a peculiar hexagonal honeycomb, i.e., the multifunctional hierarchical honeycomb (MHH). The MHH structure was developed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original regular hexagonal honeycomb (ORHH) with three kinds of equal-mass isotropic honeycomb sub-structures possessing hexagonal, triangular and Kagome lattices. Formulas to calculate the effective in-plane elastic properties and conductivities of the MHH structure at all densities were developed. Results show that the elastic properties of the MHH structure with the hexagonal sub-structure were weakly improved in contrast to those of the ORHH. However, the triangular and Kagome sub-structures result in substantial improvements by one or even three orders of magnitude on Young's and shear moduli of the MHH structure, depending on the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH. The present theory could be used in designing new tailorable hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Adhesive abilities of insects, spiders and reptiles have inspired researchers for a long time. All these organisms show outstanding performance, particularly for force, adhesion and climbing abilities, relative to their size and weight. Scientists have focused on the gecko's adhesive paw system and climbing abilities. Its adhesion mechanism has been an important topic of research for nearly 150 years. However, certain phenomena of geckos are still not fully understood and represent today the main challenge in several scientific discussions that aim to better understand their adhesive ability. The manuscript deals with the influence of surface roughness on the gecko's adhesion on the inverted surface of Poly(methyl meth-acrylate) (PMMA) and glass, of PMMA with different surface roughness, on the gecko's maximum normal adhesive force. In general, the adhesive structure and mechanism of an animal could be connected to the micro-structured roughness of natural substrata (e.g. plant surfaces) in the natural environment. This manuscript focuses on the nanometer scale, which is involved in everything from gecko spatulae to the waxy nanotubules of the lotus leaf, to the fibroin protein materials that constitute spider silks. In general, spider silks display superior mechanical properties, but only in the last few decades, researchers investigated various types of silks and evaluated their very different mechanical properties. The dragline and the flag silks (or radial and circumferential) of orb weaving spiders have been characterized in scientific literature while, to our knowledge, few studies have been conducted on bundles, which connect the cocoons of Meta menardi to the ceiling of caves.},

abstract = {Recently, it was proposed based on classical elasticity theory and experiments at macroscale, that the conformations of sheets inside cylindrical tubes present a universal behavior. A natural question is whether this behavior still holds at nanoscale. Based on molecular-dynamics simulations and analytical modeling for graphene and boron nitride membranes confined inside carbon nanotubes, we show that the class of universality observed at macroscale is violated at nanoscale. The precise origin of these discrepancies is addressed and proven to be related to both surface and atomistic effects. {\textcopyright} Copyright EPLA, 2014.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of the exceptional dry adhesion achieved by some natural biological materials has been widely investigated in recent years. In particular, the analysis of the terminal elements of gecko pads and their specific structure and topology has led to the development of bioinspired synthetic fibrillar adhesives, including mushroom-shaped tips. To model the expected adhesion and detachment behaviour of multiple contacts, only recently the last author has derived a theory of multiple peeling, extending the pioneering energy-based single peeling theory of Kendall, including large deformations and pre-stretching. In this contribution, we study the problem of the adhesion of single and multiple contacts using finite element analysis, with the aim of studying complex peeling geometries. Both non-hierarchical tape-like and hierarchical geometries are considered, and the adhesive properties are compared, showing a marked improvement in the latter case. Results are promising and the numerical approach can be exploited in future attempts to determine optimal configurations and improve the adhesion of artificial bioinspired structures. {\textcopyright} 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical and numerical analysis of the mechanical behavior of self-healing materials using an analytical model and numerical calculations both based on a Hierarchical Fiber Bundle Model, and applying them to graphene- or carbon-nanotube-based materials. The self-healing process can be described essentially through a single parameter, that is, the healing rate, but numerical simulations also highlight the influence of the location of the healing process on the overall strengthening and toughening of the material. The role of hierarchy is discussed, showing that full-scale hierarchical structures can in fact acquire more favorable properties than smaller, nonhierarchical ones through interaction with the self-healing process, thus inverting the common notion in fracture mechanics that specimen strength increases with decreasing size. Further, the study demonstrates that the developed analytical and numerical tools can be useful to develop strategies for the optimization of strength and toughness of synthetic bioinspired materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {One of the defining properties of biological structural materials is self-healing, i.e., the ability to undergo long-term reparation after instantaneous damaging events, but also after microdamage due to repeated load cycling. To correctly model the fatigue life of such materials, self-healing must be included in fracture and fatigue laws, and related codes. Here, we adopt a numerical modelization of fatigue cycling of self-healing biological materials based on the hierarchical fiber bundle model and propose modifications in Griffith's and Paris' laws to account for the presence of self-healing. Simulations allow us to numerically verify these modified expressions and highlight the effect of the self-healing rate, in particular, for collagen-based materials such as human tendons and ligaments. The study highlights the effectiveness of the self healing process even for small healing rates and provides the possibility of improving the reliability of predictions of fatigue life in biomechanics, e.g., in sports medicine.},

The proof of concept is experimentally realized making the world's toughest fibre, increasing the toughness modulus of a commercial Endumax macroscopic fibre from 44 J/g up to 1070 J/g (and of a zylon microfiber from 20 J/g up to 1400 J/g). The ideal upperbound toughness is expected for graphene, with a theoretical value of ∼105 J/g. This new concept, able of maximizing (one fold increment) the structural robustness, could explain the mysterious abundance of knot formations, in spite of their incremental energy cost and topological difficulty, in biological evolved structures, such as DNA strands and proteins. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nicola M.

abstract = {The main advantage for applications of graphene and related 2D materials is that they can be produced on large scales by liquid phase exfoliation. The exfoliation process shall be considered as a particular fragmentation process, where the 2D character of the exfoliated objects will influence significantly fragmentation dynamics as compared to standard materials. Here, we used automatized image processing of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) data to measure, one by one, the exact shape and size of thousands of nanosheets obtained by exfoliation of an important 2D-material, boron nitride, and used different statistical functions to model the asymmetric distribution of nanosheet sizes typically obtained. Being the resolution of AFM much larger than the average sheet size, analysis could be performed directly at the nanoscale and at the single sheet level. We find that the size distribution of the sheets at a given time follows a log-normal distribution, indicating that the exfoliation process has a "typical" scale length that changes with time and that exfoliation proceeds through the formation of a distribution of random cracks that follow Poisson statistics. The validity of this model implies that the size distribution does not depend on the different preparation methods used, but is a common feature in the exfoliation of this material and thus probably for other 2D materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

abstract = {The choice of a suitable area to spiders where to lay eggs is promoted in terms of Darwinian fitness. Despite its importance, the underlying factors behind this key decision are generally poorly understood. Here, we designed a multidisciplinary study based both on in-field data and laboratory experiments focusing on the European cave spider Meta menardi (Araneae, Tetragnathidae) and aiming at understanding the selective forces driving the female in the choice of the depositional area. Our in-field data analysis demonstrated a major role of air velocity and distance from the cave entrance within a particular cave in driving the female choice. This has been interpreted using a model based on the Entropy Generation Minimization-EGM-method, without invoking best fit parameters and thanks to independent lab experiments, thus demonstrating that the female chooses the depositional area according to minimal level of thermo-fluid-dynamic irreversibility. This methodology may pave the way to a novel approach in understanding evolutionary strategies for other living organisms.},

abstract = {Present paper investigates the potential application of planar nano structures with attached nano particles as nano resonant sensors by introducing a nonlocal plate model which considers size effects. To take into account an elastic connection between the nano plate and the attached nanoparticle, the nano particle is considered as a mass-spring system. Then, a mixed approach based on pseudo-spectral and integral quadrature rule is implemented to numerically determine the frequency shift caused by the attached mass-spring system. Obtained results are in a good agreement with those available in the literature which reveals that the proposed combined method provides accurate results for structural problems with concentrated objects. Results show that for soft connections with small values of spring constant the predicted frequency shift is greater than rigid connections. It means that considering a rigid connection instead of elastic one will underestimate the frequency shift of nano resonant sensors. Also, it is shown that neglecting size effects results in overestimating the frequency shift of nano resonant sensors. Furthermore, nano plates with greater aspect ratios offer smaller dimensionless frequency shifts and the maximum belongs to a square one. The presented results could be useful as a guideline for designing nano resonant sensors of plane shapes like graphene based mass sensors.},

abstract = {The anisotropic hexagonal honeycomb is one of the common honeycombs. To increase its in-plane stiffness greatly, in this paper the anisotropic multifunctional hierarchical honeycomb (AMHH) is proposed. It is constructed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original anisotropic hexagonal honeycomb (OAHH) with the equal mass isotropic substructures, triangular or Kagome honeycombs. Two kinds of AMHH structures are proposed. One corresponds to the OAHH with 120° angles between the jointed cell walls, the other one corresponds to the OAHH with angles between the jointed cell walls different from 120°. Through Euler beam theory, the in-plane stiffness of these two kinds of AMHH is analyzed. Results show that the triangular honeycomb substructures could greatly increase the in-plane stiffness of the AMHH by 1.5 times or even more than 100 times, depending on the thickness-to-length ratio of the oblique cell wall of the OAHH. And the validation of the range for the thickness-to-length ratio of the oblique cell wall, which is related to the density of the OAHH, could reach to 0.1. The present theory could be used for designing new tailorable anisotropic hierarchical honeycomb materials for multifunctional applications.},

Cementitious hollow tubes (CHT) having two different internal diameters (of 2 mm and 7.5 mm) were produced by extrusion and used as containers and releasing devices for cement paste/mortar healing agents. Based on the results of preliminary mechanical tests, sodium silicate was selected as the healing agent. The morphological features of several mix designs used to manufacture the extruded hollow tubes, as well as the coatings applied to increase the durability of both core and shell materials are discussed. Three-point bending tests were performed on samples produced with the addition of the above-mentioned cementitious hollow tubes to verify the self-healing effectiveness of the proposed solution. Promising results were achieved, in particular when tubes with a bigger diameter were used. In this case, a substantial strength and stiffness recovery was observed, even in specimens presenting large cracks (>1 mm). The method is inexpensive and simple to scale up; however, further research is needed in view of a final optimization.},

In this work, we analyze the working mechanism and performance of a nanocomposite based stretchable strain sensor by calculating the conductivity of the nanowire percolation network as a function of strain. We reveal that the nonlinear piezoresistivity is attributed to the topological change of percolation network, which leads to a bottleneck in the electric path. We find that, due to enhanced percolation, the linearity of the sensor improves with increasing aspect ratio or volume fraction of the nanowires at the expense of decreasing gauge factor. In addition, we show that a wide range of gauge factors (from negative to positive) can be obtained by changing the orientation distribution of nanowires. Our study suggests a way to intelligently design nanocomposite-based piezoresistive sensors for flexible and wearable devices.},

The initial rippling of the surface is modeled by cosine functions with a hierarchical topology. Considering both large displacement and small scale effect, the governing equilibrium equations are determined and solved. Then an equivalent bending stiffness is calculated for a rippled graphene and the effects of rippling, material discreteness, and structural dimension on its stiffness are discussed in details. The results quantify how the rippling strongly increases the effective bending stiffness of graphene and interacts with the discrete nature of the material not only because of increase in the moment of inertia. This approach can be applied to ripples design of 2D materials in order to achieve stiffening in bending as required in specific applications.},

The tensile strength of discrete volumes of limpet tooth material measured using in situ atomic force microscopy was found to range from 3.0 to 6.5 GPa and was independent of sample size. These observations highlight an absolute material tensile strength that is the highest recorded for a biological material, outperforming the high strength of spider silk currently considered to be the strongest natural material, and approaching values comparable to those of the strongest man-made fibres. This considerable tensile strength of limpet teeth is attributed to a high mineral volume fraction of reinforcing goethite nanofibres with diameters below a defect-controlled critical size, suggesting that natural design in limpet teeth is optimized towards theoretical strength limits.},

Second, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo is used to predict the adsorption properties of the proposed frameworks in the case of two different gases, notably hydrogen and carbon dioxide. While one can safely conclude that gas adsorption is strongly affected by the density of the pillars and the chemical composition of the compounds, a comparison between realistic idealized structures shows that even the corrugation of graphene sheets has a deep impact on such properties.

This design by nature is based on the optimal combination of protein solubility, self-assembled aggregate size and polymer network topology. The original homogeneous network structure becomes heterogeneous after spinning, enhancing the anisotropic network connectivity along the shear flow direction. Extending beyond the classical polymer theory, with insights from the percolation network model, we illustrate the direct proportionality between network conductance and fibre Young's modulus.

abstract = {It is known that structural biological materials such as bone or dentin show unprecedented damage tolerance, toughness, and strength. The common feature of these materials is their hierarchical heterogeneous structure, which contributes to increased energy dissipation before failure occurring at different scale levels. These structural properties are the key to achieve superior nanocomposites. Here, we develop a numerical model in order to simulate the mechanisms involved in damage progression and energy dissipation at different size scales in composites, which depend both on the heterogeneity of the material (defects or reinforcements) and on the type of hierarchical structure. Both these aspects have been incorporated into a 2-D model based on a Hierarchical Lattice Spring Model approach, accounting for geometrical non-linearities and including statistically based fracture phenomena. The model has been validated by comparing numerical results to linear elastic fracture mechanics predictions as well as to finite elements simulations, and then employed to study how hierarchical structural aspects influence composite material (mainly 2d, e.g., graphene based) properties, which is the main novel feature of the approach. Results obtained with the numerical code highlight the dependence of stress distributions (and therefore crack propagation) on matrix properties and reinforcement dispersion, geometry, and properties, and how the redistribution of stresses after the failure of sacrificial elements is directly involved in the damage tolerance of the material.},

abstract = {Continuum modeling of free-standing graphene monolayer, viewed as a two dimensional 2-lattice, requires specification of the components of the shift vector that acts as an auxiliary variable. If only in-plane motions are considered, the energy depends on an in-plane strain measure and the shift vector. The assumption of geometrical and material linearity leads to quadratic energy terms with respect to the shift vector, the strain tensor, and their combinations. Graphene's hexagonal symmetry reduces the number of independent moduli then to four. We evaluate these four material parameters using molecular calculations and the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order potential and compare them with standard linear elastic constitutive modeling. The results of our calculations show that the predicted values are in reasonable agreement with those obtained solely from our molecular calculations as well as those from the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure mechanical properties when graphene is modeled as a hexagonal 2-lattice.

Here, we investigate the effects of patterning on the tribological properties of a slider over a solid substrate. We show that, depending on the numerical density of surface grooves, the tribological properties can change significantly. A low density of surface patterning leads to a decrease of static friction force, while a higher density weakens this effect. Contrary to static friction, kinetic friction shows a much weaker dependence on surface patterning. The decrease is related to a non-uniform distribution of surface stress induced by patterning. We believe these findings and approach to be relevant for technological applications and related optimal design.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to model the Eshelby dislocation inside Pd and Ir nanowires and to predict the powder diffraction pattern using the Debye scattering equation. We find that the ideal dislocation solution by Eshelby is in good agreement with the observed twist angle and deviatoric strain, even though it ignores both the splitting of the Eshelby dislocation into two partials and surface stress. Surface stress plays a significant role only for nanorods with small aspect ratio (∼1:1). We also find that Wilson's prediction on the diffraction peak broadening for the Eshelby dislocation is overestimated because it ignores the fact that the Eshelby twist relaxes the deviatoric strain. Moreover, the twist loosens the correlation along the nanorod, causing additional line profile broadening, which is read by diffraction as a decrease of coherent domain size when the total twist angle is bigger than 1.5°. Overall, our findings suggest a novel way to predict and analyze the dislocations as well as the resulting strain fields in the twisted nanocrystalline rods.},

abstract = {Since its discovery, the wetting transparency of graphene, the transmission of the substrate wetting property over graphene coating, has gained significant attention due to its versatility for potential applications. Yet, there have been debates on the interpretation and validity of the wetting transparency. Here, we present a theory taking two previously disregarded factors into account and elucidate the origin of the partial wetting transparency. We show that the liquid bulk modulus is crucial to accurately calculate the van der Waals interactions between the liquid and the surface, and that various wetting states on rough surfaces must be considered to understand a wide range of contact angle measurements that cannot be fitted with a theory considering the flat surface. In addition, we reveal that the wetting characteristic of the substrate almost vanishes when covered by any coating as thick as graphene double layers. Our findings reveal a more complete picture of the wetting transparency of graphene as well as other atomically thin coatings, and can be applied to study various surface engineering problems requiring wettability-tuning.},

abstract = {Anticracks (also known as rigid line inclusions) occur frequently in a variety of natural and engineered composites as very stiff and extremely sharp (almost zero-thickness) fibers or lamellae embedded in a softer matrix. In the linear elastic regime, similarly to cracks, anticracks generate a singularity in the stress distribution around the tip. Because of this similarity, existing analytical techniques and solutions (for simple cases) can be easily translated to anticracks. However, despite their importance in many biological and engineering composites, there has been surprisingly little development of numerical methods that would account simultaneously for the presence of multiple fibers or lamellae, arbitrary loadings and nonlinear behavior of the matrix. This paper presents the first numerical approach for rigid line inclusions, based on a meshfree scheme recently developed for multiple crack growth in elastic media. The inclusion of zero thickness is created as a crack, and a rigid motion (rotation and translation) is enforced at the anticrack faces. The equations of motion are solved according to a Total Lagrangian framework, and the matrix supposed hyperelastic. Contrarily to available analytical solutions, the degrees of freedom of the rigid motion are determined a posteriori as a consequence of the (discretized) elastic equilibrium, expressed in a variational approach. Results show that the proposed approach match well the analytical solutions and provides accurate stress intensity factors (SIFs) for relatively little computational cost. Moreover, the method can reproduce some peculiar features of the anticracks: unlike cracks, singularities also appear under compressive and parallel loads; moreover, for a certain combination of biaxial load, stress concentrations disappear. Finally, the paper presents examples drawn from biological and engineering composites: the reorientation of one or more fibers under large strains, resulting in a smart stiffening and strengthening mechanism. Reorienting towards the direction of applied load has structural importance since reinforcements can have the most effectiveness in withstanding loads. If the matrix is compliant, the reorientation is eased.},

abstract = {Experimental studies recently performed on single cancer and healthy cells have demonstrated that the former are about 70% softer than the latter, regardless of the cell lines and the measurement technique used for determining the mechanical properties. At least in principle, the difference in cell stiffness might thus be exploited to create mechanical-based targeting strategies for discriminating neoplastic transformations within human cell populations and for designing innovative complementary tools to cell-specific molecular tumour markers, leading to possible applications in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer diseases. With the aim of characterizing and gaining insight into the overall frequency response of single-cell systems to mechanical stimuli (typically low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound), a generalized viscoelastic paradigm, combining classical and spring-pot-based models, is introduced for modelling this problem by neglecting the cascade of mechanobiological events involving the cell nucleus, cytoskeleton, elastic membrane and cytosol. Theoretical results show that differences in stiffness, experimentally observed ex vivo and in vitro, allow healthy and cancer cells to be discriminated, by highlighting frequencies (from tens to hundreds of kilohertz) associated with resonance-like phenomena-prevailing on thermal fluctuations-that could be helpful in targeting and selectively attacking tumour cells.},

abstract = {Background: The advantages of barbed suture for tendon repair could be to eliminate the need for a knot and to better distribute the load throughout the tendon so as to reduce the deformation at the repair site. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the breaking force and the repair site deformation of a new barbed tenorrhaphy technique in an animal model. Materials and methods: Sixty porcine flexor tendons were divided randomly into three groups and repaired with one of the following techniques: a new 4-strand barbed technique using 2/0 polypropylene Quill™ SRS or 2/0 polydioxanone Quill™ SRS and a modified Kessler technique using 3/0 prolene. All tendons underwent mechanical testing to assess the 2-mm gap formation force, the breaking force and the mode of failure. The percentage change in tendon cross-sectional area before and after repair was calculated. Results: The two-sample Student t-test demonstrated a significant increase in 2-mm gap formation force and in breaking force with barbed sutures, independently from suture material, when compared to traditional Kessler suture. Concerning the tendon profile, we registered less bunching at the repair site in the two barbed groups compared with the Kessler group. Conclusions: This study confirms the promising results achieved in previous ex vivo studies about the use of barbed suture in flexor tendon repair. In our animal model, tenorrhaphy with Quill™ SRS suture guarantees a breaking force of repair that exceeds the 40–50 N suggested as sufficient to initiate early active motion, and a smoother profile at the repair site.

abstract = {Due to the difficulty of performing uniaxial tensile testing, the strengths of graphene and its grain boundaries have been measured in experiments by nanoindentation testing. From a series of molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the strength measured in uniaxial simulation and the strength estimated from the nanoindentation fracture force can differ significantly. Fracture in tensile loading occurs simultaneously with the onset of crack nucleation near 5-7 defects, while the graphene sheets often sustain the indentation loads after the crack initiation because the sharply concentrated stress near the tip does not give rise to enough driving force for further crack propagation. Due to the concentrated stress, strength estimation is sensitive to the indenter tip position along the grain boundaries. Also, it approaches the strength of pristine graphene if the tip is located slightly away from the grain boundary line. Our findings reveal the limitations of nanoindentation testing in quantifying the strength of graphene, and show that the loading-mode-specific failure mechanism must be taken into account in designing reliable devices from graphene and other technologically important 2D materials.},

At the same time, the concept of chaotic cavities has been recently proposed as an efficient tool to enhance the quality of nonlinear signal analysis, particularly in the ultrasonic/acoustic case. The goal of the present paper is to merge the two concepts in order to propose a metamaterial-based device that can be used as a natural and selective linear filter for the detection of signals resulting from the propagation of elastic waves in nonlinear materials, e.g., in the presence of damage, and as a detector for the damage itself in time reversal experiments. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and the potential of the device in providing improved signal-to-noise ratios and enhanced focusing on the defect locations.},

Irregular hierarchical honeycombs can be up to 3 times stiffer than regular hexagonal honeycombs on an equal density basis. Both the stiffness and Poisson's ratio of the hierarchical honeycomb are insensitive to the degree of regularity, and depend on the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the super-structure.

Tuned voltage lead to different thickness of deposited GO steadily increasing with the electric field up to 10 V/cm. Coated fibers were aligned in a mold and an epoxy matrix was used to create a single-fiber microcomposite. Fragmentation test showed significantly higher ISS values for coated over bare fibers with increments up to a factor of about 2 and proportional to the amount of GO deposited on the GF. Tribological tests were performed at nanoscale by atomic force microscopy to measure the delamination strength between GO and GF. This latter resulted to be much higher than the ISS thus proving the efficiency of the new GO fiber coating method here proposed for producing advanced graphene based composites. The failure of the composite at the GO/matrix rather than at the GO/GF interface was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy observation of the fracture surfaces of microcomposites.},

However, their toughness is considerably smaller than that of some natural fibres such as spider silk, thus limiting their performance in applications ranging from surgical devices to vehicle parts. Here, we implement a recently proposed strategy, using micro-knots as frictional energy dissipators, to achieve record toughness values of up to 1400 J/g in synthetic microfibres, while maintaining their strength virtually unchanged. The same strategy is also applied to carbon nanotube microfibres, exploiting their superior ideal mechanical strength compared to any other existing fibre at the nanoscale, and toughness improvements of more than an order of magnitude are observed. We also show how knotted nanotube fibre configurations can be optimized for maximum toughness by modifying fibre diameter and twist angle, and how frictional and wear levels can be tuned by varying tightening and number of coils in the micro-knots. The results demonstrate the potential to design and produce fibres and textiles with unprecedented simultaneous strength and toughness for a variety of technological applications.},

In this article we prepared silicone rubber (SR)-graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) composite via liquid mixing method; the mechanical strength of the GNPs estimated by applying quantized fracture mechanics suggested a severe GNPs agglomeration that was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. We observe that such SR/GNP composite behaves as a negative temperature coefficient material, exhibiting electrical resistance decrease with temperature increase. It was also shown how the damaged SR/GNP composite can be healed by simple thermal annealing. The healing mechanism was rationalized in terms of “living” reactive species that are not consumed by curing at room temperature and promote, when thermally activated, the crosslinking among the damaged network of oligomers. The healing efficiency, expressed as crack length vs. annealing temperature, has been estimated again applying the principles of quantized fracture mechanics. These results could satisfy many of the demanding requirements of the silicone rubber materials used in daily life and indicate that SR/GNP composites can act as healable and temperature sensor materials e. g. for seals, hoses and automotive sector.},

abstract = {Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer rubber (EPDM)-based nanocomposites containing carbon black (CB), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and mixtures of the two fillers were prepared. The influence of the relative amounts of the two fillers on the dynamic and static friction coefficients was examined. The static analysis of the coefficient of friction suggests that the partial substitution GNPs into the EPDM/CB blend did not produce a significant variation of the surface grip. The sample comprising EPDM/CB composite and an effective amount of GNPs dispersed in the matrix provides an increase of the thermal conductivity, damping (i. e. shock absorbing properties) and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy and micro tomography analyses showed that the replacement of CB with GNPs reduces the CB aggregation and, hence, improving the percolation of the hybrid fillers and the interface resistance of the composite. The development of thermally conducting elastomeric nanocomposites could envisage their utilization in the processing of rubber blends satisfying the increasing demand to reduce both the duration of the vulcanization process and thus the cost of the vulcanized rubbers.},

abstract = {Conventional wetting theories on rough surfaces with Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and Penetrate modes suggest the possibility of tuning the contact angle by adjusting the surface texture. Despite decades of intensive study, there are still many experimental results that are not well understood because conventional wetting theory, which assumes an infinite droplet size, has been used to explain measurements of finite-sized droplets. Here, we suggest a wetting theory applicable to a wide range of droplet size for the three wetting modes by analyzing the free energy landscape with many local minima originated from the finite size. We find that the conventional theory predicts the contact angle at the global minimum if the droplet size is about 40 times or larger than the characteristic scale of the surface roughness, regardless of wetting modes. Furthermore, we obtain the energy barrier of pinning which can induce the contact angle hysteresis as a function of geometric factors. We validate our theory against experimental results on an anisotropic rough surface. In addition, we discuss the wetting on non-uniformly rough surfaces. Our findings clarify the extent to which the conventional wetting theory is valid and expand the physical understanding of wetting phenomena of small liquid drops on rough surfaces.},

abstract = {Structural hierarchy coupled with material heterogeneity is often identified in natural materials, from the nano- to the macroscale. It combines disparate mechanical properties, such as strength and toughness, and multifunctionality, such as smart adhesion, water repellence, self-cleaning, and self-healing. Hierarchical architectures can be employed in synthetic bioinspired structured materials, also adopting constituents with superior mechanical properties, such as carbon nanotubes or graphene. Advanced computational modeling is essential to understand the complex mechanisms that couple material, structural, and topological hierarchy, merging phenomena of different nature, size, and time scales. Numerical modeling also allows extensive parametric studies for the optimization of material properties and arrangement, avoiding time-consuming and complex experimental trials, and providing guidance in the fabrication of novel advanced materials. Here, we review some of the most promising approaches, with a focus on the methods developed by our group.},

abstract = {The hierarchical organization of many biological materials plays a key role in their exceptional mechanical properties. Existing studies investigate how hierarchy affects the mechanical behavior of cellular materials and the vast majority of them assume empty cells. In reality, in numerous natural systems the cells are filled with fluids, fibers or other bulk materials to better resist external stimuli. Inspired by the highly efficiency of nature, this paper investigates the effects of adding hierarchy into a composite cellular material. Initially, the analytical expressions for the effective elastic moduli derived in the case of self-similarity reveal the system isotropy as for the not filled configuration. Then, from parametric analysis emerges a strong influence of the microstructure on the overall properties. We discovered that adding hierarchical levels to a filled cellular material can lead to a higher material specific stiffness only if the filler is stiffer than a critical value. Thus for classical cellular materials hierarchy is detrimental for the specific stiffness. In spite of this, for composite cellular solids an optimal number of hierarchical levels naturally emerges. In addition, numerical homogenization validates the analytical approach. Finally, the example of a hierarchical composite cellular material having different levels with different cell topologies is also considered. The present analysis provides an insight into the role of structural hierarchy on the in-plane elastic properties of composite cellular materials, as well as some possible ways to improve low-weight cellular structures by mixing different materials and varying the cell topology.},

abstract = {Spider silk is a remarkable example of bio-material with superior mechanical characteristics. Its multilevel structural organization of dragline and viscid silk leads to unusual and tunable properties, extensively studied from a quasi-static point of view. In this study, inspired by the Nephila spider orb web architecture, we propose a design for mechanical metamaterials based on its periodic repetition. We demonstrate that spider-web metamaterial structure plays an important role in the dynamic response and wave attenuation mechanisms. The capability of the resulting structure to inhibit elastic wave propagation in sub-wavelength frequency ranges is assessed, and parametric studies are performed to derive optimal configurations and constituent mechanical properties. The results show promise for the design of innovative lightweight structures for tunable vibration damping and impact protection, or the protection of large scale infrastructure such as suspended bridges.},

abstract = {This paper presents experimental data and analysis of the structural damage caused by swift-heavy ion irradiation of single-crystal diamond. The patterned buried structural damage is shown to generate, via swelling, a mirror-pattern on the sample surface, which remains largely damage-free. While extensive results are available for light ion implantations, this effect is reported here for the first time in the heavy ion regime, where a completely different range of input parameters (in terms of ion species, energy, stopping power, etc.) is available for customized irradiation. The chosen ion species are Au and Br, in the energy range 10–40 MeV. The observed patterns, as characterized by profilometry and atomic force microscopy, are reported in a series of model experiments, which show swelling patterns ranging from a few nm to above 200 nm. Moreover, a systematic phenomenological modeling is presented, in which surface swelling measurements are correlated to buried crystal damage. A comparison is made with data for light ion implantations, showing good compatibility with the proposed models. The modeling presented in this work can be useful for the design and realization of micropatterned surfaces in single crystal diamond, allowing generating highly customized structures by combining appropriately chosen irradiation parameters and masks.},

abstract = {Development and characterization of porous scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is of great importance. In recent times, silk scaffolds were developed and successfully tested in tissue engineering and drug release applications. We developed a novel composite scaffold by mechanical infusion of silk hydrogel matrix into a highly porous network silk scaffold. The mechanical behaviour of these scaffolds was thoroughly examined for their possible use in load bearing applications. Firstly, unconfined compression experiments show that the denser composite scaffolds displayed significant enhancement in the elastic modulus as compared to either of the components. This effect was examined and further explained with the help of foam mechanics principles. Secondly, results from confined compression experiments that resemble loading of cartilage in confinement, showed nonlinear material responses for all scaffolds. Finally, the confined creep experiments were performed to calculate the hydraulic permeability of the scaffolds using soil mechanics principles. Our results show that composite scaffolds with some modifications can be a potential candidate for use of cartilage like applications. We hope such approaches help in developing novel scaffolds for tissue engineering by providing an understanding of the mechanics and can further be used to develop graded scaffolds by targeted infusion in specific regions.},

Since only a few bio-engineering studies have been focused on spider silk ageing, we conducted nano-tensile tests on the vertical naturally spun silk fibers of the bridge spider Larinioides cornutus (Clerck, 1757) (Arachnida, Araneae) to evaluate changes in the mechanical properties of the silk (ultimate stress and strain, Youngs modulus, toughness) over time. We studied the natural process of silk ageing at different time intervals from spinning (20 seconds up to one month), comparing silk fibers spun from adult spiders collected in the field. Data were analyzed using Linear Mixed Models. We detected a positive trend versus time for the Youngs modulus, indicating that aged silks are stiffer and possibly less effective in catching prey. Moreover, we observed a negative trend for the ultimate strain versus time, attesting a general decrement of the resistance force. These trends are interpreted as being due to the drying of the silk protein chains and the reorientation among the fibers.},

In reality, and certainly for biological tissues, the internal volumes are instead filled with fluids, fibers or other bulk materials. Inspired by these architectures, this paper presents a continuum model for composite cellular materials. A series of closely spaced independent linear-elastic springs approximates the filling material. Firstly, finite element simulations performed on the microstructure and numerical homogenization demonstrate a convergence towards non-micro polarity, in contrast to classical empty materials. Secondly, theoretical homogenization, in its most general setting, confirms that the gradients of micro-rotations disappear in the continuum limit. In addition, the resulting constitutive model remains isotropic, as for the non-filled cellular structures, and reconciles with existing studies where the filling material is absent. Finally, the model is applied for estimating the mechanical properties of parenchyma tissues (carrots, apples and potatoes). The theory provides values for Young moduli reasonably close to the ones measured experimentally for turgid samples.},

Structural hierarchy provides a way to tune and optimize macroscopic mechanical properties starting from simple base constituents and new materials are nowadays designed exploiting this possibility. This can be true also in the field of tribology. In this paper we study the effect of hierarchical patterned surfaces on the static and dynamic friction coefficients of an elastic material. Our results are obtained by means of numerical simulations using a one-dimensional spring-block model, which has previously been used to investigate various aspects of friction. Despite the simplicity of the model, we highlight some possible mechanisms that explain how hierarchical structures can significantly modify the friction coefficients of a material, providing a means to achieve tunability.},

abstract = {Recently, the use of acellular matrices in tissue engineering has become extremely significant as tissue substitute for organ/tissue reconstruction. In this clinical scenario, banking decellularised organs ready for transplantation would be mandatory for patients with emergency needs. In this work a new process based on supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) drying technique was investigated for obtaining a dry/preserved decellularized oesophagus. Experiments were performed coupling a detergent enzymatic treatment with two different protocols: (i) SC-CO2 drying; (ii) dehydration in ethanol and a subsequent SC-CO2 drying. The efficiency of the treatments was investigated by monitoring the loss of weight of the treated samples and the maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture, composition and mechanical properties after rehydration. A successful dry acellular matrix was reached in a shorter time using the combined ethanol and SC-CO2 treatment. Histological analysis reported the maintenance of the tissue matrix architecture and the collagen content for all the treated samples, while the preservation of ultrastructural features were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tensile tests did not show significant differences in terms of fracture strength before and after the supercritical process. Furthermore, the scaffolds demonstrated good biocompatible properties in terms of cell culture viability in vitro. Overall, the results highlighted the potential of this novel technology to obtain a dried acellular matrix for oesophageal regeneration, preserving the extracellular matrix structure of the native tissue.},

abstract = {Earthquakes represent one of the most catastrophic natural events affecting mankind. At present, a universally accepted risk mitigation strategy for seismic events remains to be proposed. Most approaches are based on vibration isolation of structures rather than on the remote shielding of incoming waves. In this work, we propose a novel approach to the problem and discuss the feasibility of a passive isolation strategy for seismic waves based on large-scale mechanical metamaterials, including for the first time numerical analysis of both surface and guided waves, soil dissipation effects, and adopting a full 3D simulations. The study focuses on realistic structures that can be effective in frequency ranges of interest for seismic waves, and optimal design criteria are provided, exploring different metamaterial configurations, combining phononic crystals and locally resonant structures and different ranges of mechanical properties. Dispersion analysis and full-scale 3D transient wave transmission simulations are carried out on finite size systems to assess the seismic wave amplitude attenuation in realistic conditions. Results reveal that both surface and bulk seismic waves can be considerably attenuated, making this strategy viable for the protection of civil structures against seismic risk. The proposed remote shielding approach could open up new perspectives in the field of seismology and in related areas of low-frequency vibration damping or blast protection.},

abstract = {In this paper the fermentation process activated by living microorganisms of the baker's yeast is proposed as a facile assembly method of hybrid nanoparticles at liquid interface. Water dispersion of commercial baker's yeast extract used for bread production, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were added to oil/water interface; when the yeast is activated by adding sugar, the byproduct carbon dioxide bubbles migrate from the water phase to the oil/water interface generating a floating nanostructured film at liquid interface where it is trapped. Starting from this simple method, we propose a general approach for the stabilization of intractable poly(etheretherketone) polymeric particles with GNPs and CNTs at immiscible liquid interface. This process allowed the formation of sintered porous composites with improved mechanical properties. The porous structure of the composites gave rise to a low thermal conductivity making them good candidates for thermal insulating applications. Liquid absorption by these porous composites has been also reported. We believe that this new approach may have applications in the large scale fabrication of nanomaterials and is particularly suited for the preparation of nanocomposites starting from polymers that are intractable by solvent casting.},

It has been recognized that ice shows different friction regimes, but a detailed description of all the different phenomena and processes occurring at the interface, including the effect of surface roughness of both the ice and the antagonist material is still missing. In this work the effect of surface morphology on the friction of steel/ice interfaces is studied. Different degrees of random roughness on steel surfaces are introduced and the friction coefficient is measured over a wide range of temperature and sliding velocity. Correlation between the surface roughness and the lubrication regime and friction coefficient is discussed. A theoretical model is developed in order to explain this correlation, and to control the tribological behavior of the system by a proper selection of surface roughness parameters.},

These single-atom-thick materials have shown great promise for emerging nanotechnological applications, with unique electrical, thermal, and optical properties. Underlying their success as a platform for nanosystem development is their structural integrity, mechanical stability, and limit states in loading and deformation. As such, a full understanding of their mechanistic behavior, properties, and failure modes is essential for the successful implementation of 2D materials in design. Here, we focus on the fundamental nanomechanics of 2D materials, describing how to characterize basic properties such as strength, stiffness, bending rigidity, and adhesion using computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD). Failure is discussed in terms of the local, atomistic interpretation of quantized fracture mechanics (QFM), and extended to bulk systems via nanoscale Weibull statistics (NWS). While 2D materials have shown promise in nanotechnology, in terms of complete understanding of the mechanical behavior of these systems, we have merely scratched the surface.},

abstract = {The tribological properties of metal-supported few-layered graphene depend strongly on the grain topology of the metal substrate. Inhomogeneous distribution of graphene layers at such regions led to variable landscapes with distinguishable roughness. This discrepancy in morphology significantly affects the frictional and wetting characteristics of the FLG system. We discretely measured friction characteristics of FLG covering grains and interfacial grain boundaries of polycrystalline Ni metal substrate via an atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe. The friction coefficient of FLG covered at interfacial grain boundaries is found to be lower than that on grains in vacuum (at 10-5 Torr pressure) and similar results were obtained in air condition. Sliding history with AFM cantilever, static and dynamic pull-in and pull-off adhesion forces were addressed in the course of friction measurements to explain the role of the out-of-plane deformation of graphene layer(s). Finite element simulations showed good agreement with experiments and led to a rationalization of the observations. Thus, with interfacial grain boundaries the FLG tribology can be effectively tuned.},

abstract = {In this work we present a new method to generate hierarchical surfaces, inspired by lotus leaf, on a silicon substrate. Mimicking leafs with particular properties, such as low adhesion, water repellence and self-cleaning, is an interesting case of study in the branch of bioinspired materials. These properties arise from a combination of surface chemistry and topography. The lotus leaf surface exhibits a highly controlled specific roughness, which has been studied and imitated by several researchers. The great challenge that has still to be solved is to reproduce lotus-inspired surfaces rapidly and on large areas. Our method consists in a combination of wet and dry etch with soft lithography, able to generate nano- and micro- hierarchical structures on silicon surfaces. Two different kinds of hierarchical structures are generated by changing the order of the etch steps. The surfaces generated were then characterized by measuring both the contact angle and the sliding angle. Finally, to validate experimental results, analytical models were implemented to predict the contact angle. The best surface displayed wetting performances superior even to those of the natural lotus leaf, thanks to the hierarchical structure, with a contact angle of 171° and a tilt angle of 4° with production time of about 90 min per silicon wafer, or 30 s/cm2.},

Cracks and microcracks, however, are difficult to detect and often repair processes are complex.

abstract = {Any industrial application aiming at exploiting the exceptional properties of graphene in composites or coatings is currently limited by finding viable production methods for large volumes of good quality and high aspect ratio graphene, few layer graphene (FLG) or graphite nanoplatelets (GNP). Final properties of the resulting composites are inherently related to those of the initial graphitic nanoparticles, which typically depend on time-consuming, resource-demanding and/or low yield liquid exfoliation processes. In addition, efficient dispersion of these nanofillers in polymer matrices, and their interaction, is of paramount importance. Here we show that it is possible to produce graphene/epoxy nanocomposites in situ and with high conversion of graphite to FLG/GNP through the process of three-roll milling (TRM), without the need of any additives, solvents, compatibilisers or chemical treatments. This readily scalable production method allows for more than 5 wt % of natural graphite (NG) to be directly exfoliated into FLG/GNP and dispersed in an epoxy resin. The in situ exfoliated graphitic nanoplatelets, with average aspect ratios of 300-1000 and thicknesses of 5-17 nm, were demonstrated to conferee exceptional enhancements in mechanical and electrical properties to the epoxy resin. The above conclusions are discussed and interpreted in terms of simple analytical models.},

The mechanical deformation of the nanostructure in the peeling experiment is critical to the understanding of the peeling process and the interpretation of the peeling measurements, but it is challenging to measure directly and quantitatively at the nanoscale. Here, we investigate the peeling deformation of a bundled carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber by using an in situ scanning electron microscopy nanomechanical peeling technique. A pre-calibrated atomic force microscopy cantilever is utilized as the peeling force sensor, and its back surface acts as the peeling contact substrate. The nanomechanical peeling scheme enables a quantitative characterization of the deformational behaviors of the CNT fiber in both positive and negative peeling configurations with sub-10 nm spatial and sub-nN force resolutions. Nonlinear continuum mechanics models and finite element simulations are employed to interpret the peeling measurements. The measurements and analysis reveal that the structural imperfections in the CNT fiber may have a substantial influence on its peeling deformations and the corresponding peeling forces. The research findings reported in this work are useful to the study of mechanical and adhesion properties of 1D nanostructures by using nanomechanical peeling techniques.},

abstract = {Graphene shows considerable promise in structural composite applications thanks to its unique combination of high tensile strength, Young's modulus and structural flexibility which arise due to its maximal chemical bond strength and minimal atomic thickness. However, the ultimate performance of graphene composites will depend, in addition to the properties of the matrix and interface, on the morphology of the graphene used, including the size and shape of the sheets and the number of chemical defects present. For example, whilst oxidized sp3 carbon atoms and vacancies in a graphene sheet can degrade its mechanical strength, they can also increase its interaction with other materials such as the polymer matrix of a composite, thus maximizing stress transfer and leading to more efficient mechanical reinforcement. Herein, we present an overview of some recently published work on graphene mechanical properties and discuss a list of challenges that need to be overcome (notwithstanding the strong hype existing on this material) for the development of graphene-based materials into a successful technology.},

abstract = {Composites, materials composed of two or more materials—metallic, organic, or inorganic—usually exhibit the combined physical properties of their component materials. The result is a material that is superior to conventional monolithic materials. Advanced composites are used in a variety of industrial applications and therefore attract much scientific interest. Here the formation of novel carbon-based nanocomposites is described via incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) into the crystal lattice of single crystals of calcite. Incorporation of a 2D organic material into single-crystal lattices has never before been reported. To characterize the resulting nanocomposites, high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and nanoindentation tests are employed. A detailed analysis reveals a layered distribution of GO sheets incorporated within the calcite host. Moreover, the optical and mechanical properties of the calcite host are altered when a carbon-based nanomaterial is introduced into its lattice. Compared to pure calcite, the composite GO/calcite crystals exhibits lower elastic modulus and higher hardness. The results of this study show that the incorporation of a 2D material within a 3D crystal lattice is not only feasible but also can lead to the formation of hybrid crystals exhibiting new properties.},

abstract = {Enhanced comminution in a planetary ball mill was achieved by suitably re-designing the jar shape. Compared with a traditional cylindrical vial of circular cross-section, the new jar was modified internally to have a flat wall portion resulting in a half moon cross-section. Results from simulations using a multibody dynamics software, suggest that this geometry increases the number of high-velocity collisions with energy exchange along the axial direction, deemed as more effective in the comminution process. X-ray diffraction line profiles of calcium fluoride (CaF2) ground in the two jars under equivalent conditions were used to obtain information on the microstructure resulting from the milling process and validate the modelling results. A better homogeneity and a faster reduction of crystallite size were achieved using the new design compared to that using the standard cylindrical vial design. Optimal operating conditions, in terms of jar-to-plate angular velocity ratio, are correlated and discussed according to the model predictions.},

abstract = {In this work, new advances concerning the feasibility of extruded cementitious hollow tubes as containing/releasing devices for healing agents and their potential scaling up are presented. Specifically, sodium silicate and potassium silicate were evaluated as healing agents in terms of their ability to diffuse through cracks and of their ability to restore the initial mechanical properties of mortars. Their effect was investigated also in combination with the use of a hydrophobic coating applied to the inner surface of some of the hollow tubes to enhance the release of the healing agents along the crack path. A colorant was added to the sodium/potassium silicate solutions to help highlighting the fracture area covered by the healing agents, thus allowing a qualitative evaluation of the effect of the hydrophobic coating. Finally, image analysis was performed to correlate the mechanical strength/stiffness recovery to the area covered by the healing agent, as well as to the position of the tubes within the samples. On the whole, satisfactory results were obtained as far as restoration of the mechanical properties is concerned: the best performance was displayed when using cementitious hollow tube containing sodium silicate, with maximum values of bending load and stiffness recovery for the system of more than 70% and 50%, respectively.},

abstract = {Mechanical vibrational resonances in metal nanoparticles are intensively studied because they provide insight into nanoscale elasticity and for their potential application to ultrasensitive mass detection. In this paper, we use broadband femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to study the longitudinal acoustic phonons of arrays of gold nanorods with different aspect ratios, fabricated by electron beam lithography with very high size uniformity. We follow in real time the impulsively excited extensional oscillations of the nanorods by measuring the transient shift of the localized surface plasmon band. Broadband and high-sensitivity detection of the time-dependent extinction spectra enables one to develop a model that quantitatively describes the periodic variation of the plasmon extinction coefficient starting from the steady-state spectrum with only one additional free parameter. This model allows us to retrieve the time-dependent elongation of the nanorods with an ultrahigh sensitivity and to measure oscillation amplitudes of just a few picometers and plasmon energy shifts on the order of 10-2 meV.},

Thus, revealing the robustness of the interlocking mechanical behavior of the barbules is very important to understand the function and long-term resilience of bird feathers.

The results indicate a high robustness and flaw-tolerant design of the structure. This work contributes to the understanding of the mechanical behavior of the robust interlocking barb-barbule structure of the bird feather, and provides a basis for design of feather-inspired materials with robust interlocking mechanism, such as advanced bio-inspired micro-zipping devices.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the self-stress state of single-walled Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) and Flat Graphene Strips (FGSs) in their natural equilibrium state, that is, the state prior to the application of external loads. We model CNTs as discrete elastic structures, whose shape and volume changes are governed by a Reactive Empirical Bond-Order (REBO) interatomic potential of second generation. The kinematical variables we consider are bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles; to changes of each of these variables we associate a work-conjugate nanostress. To determine the self-stress state in a given CNT, we formulate the load-free equilibrium problem as a minimum problem for the interatomic potential, whose solution yields the equilibrium nanostresses; next, by exploiting the nonlinear constitutive dependence we derive for nanostresses in terms of a list of kinematical variables, we determine the equilibrium values of the latter; finally, from the equilibrium values of the kinematical variables we deduce the natural geometry and, in particular, the natural radius. Our theoretical framework accommodates CNTs of whatever chirality. In the achiral case, the stationarity conditions implied by energy minimization are relatively easy to derive and solve numerically, because we can count on maximal intrinsic symmetries and hence the number of independent unknowns is reduced to a minimum; for chiral CNTs, we prefer to solve the minimum problem directly. The natural-radius predictions we achieve within our discrete-mechanics framework are in good agreement with the results of calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Tight Binding (TB) theory; the same is true for our predictions of the self-energy, that is, the energy associated with self-stress (called cohesive energy in the literature); we surmise that our discrete mechanical model may serve as a source of benchmarks for Molecular-Dynamics (MD) simulation algorithms. We find that self-stress depends on changes in both bond and dihedral angles in achiral CNTs and, in addition, on changes in bond length in chiral CNTs. Our analysis applies also to FGSs, whose self-stress and self-energy we evaluate; we find that in FGSs self-stress is associated exclusively with changes in bond angle.},

Post-fabrication thermal annealing was then conducted on sample sets of different MWNT concentrations, and their microstructure, morphology, and mechanical properties were compared to non-annealed sample sets. The incorporation of MWNTs significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites at least up to 3 wt%. In addition, annealing altered the microstructure and morphology of the latex matrix, which enhanced the interactions between MWNTs and the polymer, significantly increasing the composite ultimate failure strain and tensile strength. Furthermore, the reinforcing effects of MWNTs on the polymer matrix were investigated using numerical simulations. Stress concentrations were found to initiate at MWNT ends, thus giving rise to yielding fronts that tend to coalesce and propagate across the entire film. The enhancement of the mechanical properties of MWNT-latex nanocomposites, also verified numerically, makes them more suitable for field application as multifunctional coatings or sensors.},

abstract = {A combined experimental and numerical study on the variation of the elastic properties of defective single-crystal diamond is presented for the first time, by comparing nano-indentation measurements on MeV-ion-implanted samples with multi-scale modeling consisting of both ab initio atomistic calculations and meso-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. It is found that by locally introducing defects in the 2 × 1018–5 × 1021 cm−3 density range, a significant reduction of Young's modulus, as well as of density, can be induced in the diamond crystal structure without incurring in the graphitization of the material. Ab initio atomistic simulations confirm the experimental findings with a good degree of confidence. FEM simulations are further employed to verify the consistency of measured deformations with a stiffness reduction, and to derive strain and stress levels in the implanted region. Combining these experimental and numerical results, we also provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the depth dependence of the graphitization threshold in diamond. This work prospects the possibility of achieving accurate tunability of the mechanical properties of single-crystal diamond through defect engineering, with significant technological applications, e.g. the fabrication and control of the resonant frequency of diamond-based micromechanical resonators.},

abstract = {Multi-layer graphene assemblies (MLGs) or fibers with a staggered architecture exhibit high toughness and failure strain that surpass those of the constituent single sheets. However, how the architectural parameters such as the sheet overlap length affect these mechanical properties remains unknown due in part to the limitations of mechanical continuum models. By exploring the mechanics of MLG assemblies under tensile deformation using our established coarse-grained molecular modeling framework, we have identified three different critical interlayer overlap lengths controlling the strength, plastic stress, and toughness of MLGs, respectively. The shortest critical length scale Lsc governs the strength of the assembly as predicted by the shear-lag model. The intermediate critical length Lpc is associated with a dynamic frictional process that governs the strain localization propensity of the assembly, and hence the failure strain. The largest critical length scale LTc corresponds to the overlap length necessary to achieve 90% of the maximum theoretical toughness of the material. Our analyses provide the general guidelines for tuning the constitutive properties and toughness of multilayer 2D nanomaterials using elasticity, interlayer adhesion energy and geometry as molecular design parameters.},

abstract = {In recent years, acoustic metamaterials have attracted increasing scientific interest for very diverse technological applications ranging from sound abatement to ultrasonic imaging, mainly due to their ability to act as band-stop filters. At the same time, the concept of chaotic cavities has been recently proposed as an efficient tool to enhance the quality of nonlinear signal analysis, particularly in the ultrasonic/acoustic case. The goal of the present work is to merge the two concepts to propose a metamaterial-based device that can be used as a natural and selective linear filter for the detection of signals resulting from the propagation of elastic waves in nonlinear solids, e.g., in the presence of damage, and as a detector for the damage itself in time reversal experiments. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements based on scanning laser Doppler vibrometer demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and the potential of the device in providing improved signal to noise ratios and enhanced focusing on scatterer locations.},

abstract = {High kinetic energy impacts between inorganic surfaces and molecular beams seeded by organics represent a fundamental tool in materials science, particularly when they activate chemical-physical processes leading to nanocrystals' growth. Here we demonstrate single-layer graphene synthesis on copper by C60 supersonic molecular beam (SuMBE) epitaxy. A growth temperature down to 645°C, lower than that typical of chemical vapour deposition (1000°C), is achieved by thermal decomposition of C60 with the possibility of further reduction. Using a variety of electron spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and first-principles simulations, we describe the chemical-physical mechanisms activated by SuMBE and assisted by thermal processes, resulting in graphene growth. In particular, we find a role of high kinetic energy deposition in enhancing the organic/inorganic interface interaction and controlling the fullerene cage openings. These results, while discussed in the specific case of graphene on copper, are potentially extendible to different metallic or semiconductor substrates and where lower processing temperature is desirable.},

The present study aims to investigate the influence of out-of-plane defects on vibrational analysis of single layered graphene sheets (SLGSs) implementing both nonlocal elasticity and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In nonlocal analysis, the defect is considered as an initial curvature which is modeled by an analytical function having controllable parameters for the amplitude, extension, and location of defects. In molecular dynamics section, defects are simulated by inserting inverse Stone-Wales defects in the perfect structure of SLGSs. Both nonlocal continuum and MD simulation results reveal that the defects increase the frequency. It is shown that the classical elasticity, overestimates frequencies with a considerable error while the nonlocal plate model can fit MD results by implementing a proper small scale parameter.},

abstract = {In this work, a novel bionic composite inspired by the concept of yeast fermentation has been proposed. It was observed that the addition of graphene nanoplatelets during the fermentation of extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungi allows coupling of the graphene sheets to the yeast cell wall. This process resulted in the formation of a composite film with improved mechanical and electrical properties along with the capability of converting the light stimulus in the electrical signal. The mechanical properties of the prepared composites, namely, the fracture strength and Young's modulus, were studied via numerical simulations and are related to the properties of the constituent phases via rules of mixture. Finally, it was observed that graphene nanoplatelets, added to the nutrient broth, were able to reassemble onto the stressed cell surface and repair the surface cracking, partially restoring the pristine electrical and mechanical properties. The method reported here may find potential application in the development of self-healable bioelectronic devices and microorganism-based strain and chemical biosensors. (Figure Presented).},

abstract = {The exploitation of the processes used by microorganisms to digest nutrients for their growth can be a viable method for the formation of a wide range of so called biogenic materials that have unique properties that are not produced by abiotic processes. Here we produced living hybrid materials by giving to unicellular organisms the nutrient to grow. Based on bread fermentation, a bionic composite made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a single-cell fungi, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast extract, was prepared by fermentation of such microorganisms at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy analysis suggests that the CNTs were internalized by the cell after fermentation bridging the cells. Tensile tests on dried composite films have been rationalized in terms of a CNT cell bridging mechanism where the strongly enhanced strength of the composite is governed by the adhesion energy between the bridging carbon nanotubes and the matrix. The addition of CNTs also significantly improved the electrical conductivity along with a higher photoconductive activity. The proposed process could lead to the development of more complex and interactive structures programmed to self-assemble into specific patterns, such as those on strain or light sensors that could sense damage or convert light stimulus in an electrical signal.},

abstract = {Salvinia leaves represent an extraordinary example of how nature found a strategy for the long term retainment of air, and thus oxygen, on a surface, the so-called 'Salvinia effect', thanks to the peculiar three-dimensional and hierarchical shape of the hairs covering the leaves. Here, starting from the natural model, we have microfabricated hairs inspired by those present on the Salvinia molesta leaves, by means of direct laser lithography. Artificial hairs, like their natural counterpart, are composed of a stalk and a crown-like head, and have been reproduced in the microscale since this ensures, if using a proper design, an air-retaining behavior even if the bulk structural material is hydrophilic. We have investigated the capability of air retainment inside the heads of the hairs that can last up to 100 h, demonstrating the stability of the phenomenon. For a given dimension of the head, the greater the number of filaments, the greater the amount of air that can be trapped inside the heads since the increase in the number of solid-air interfaces able to pin the liquid phase. For this reason, such type of pattern could be used for the fabrication of surfaces for controlled gas retainment and gas release in liquid phases. The range of applications would be quite large, including industrial, medical, and biological fields.},

In this work, freely suspended poly(L-lactic acid) nanofilms with controlled morphology embedding superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were fabricated by spin-coating deposition. The mechanical properties of magnetic nanofilms were investigated by Strain-Induced Elastic Buckling Instability for Mechanical Measurements (SIEBIMM) test. Our results show that these freely suspended nanocomposite nanofilms are highly flexible and deformable, with Young's moduli of few GPa. Since they can be handled in liquid with syringes, a quantitative description of the nanofilms behavior during the manipulation with clinically applicable needles has been also provided. These magnetic nanofilms, remotely controllable by external electromagnetic fields, have potential applications in minimally invasive surgery as injectable nanopatches on inner organs wall.

In this approach the response of SLGSs against unidirectional tensile loading is matched to the response of a frame-like macro structure containing beam elements by making an equivalence between strain energies of beam elements in MSM and potential energies of chemical bonds of SLGSs. Both chirality and size effects are considered and the atomistic evaluation of stress concentration factor is performed for different sizes of circular holes. Also, molecular dynamics simulations are implemented to verify the existence and location of the predicted stress concentration. The results reveal that size effects and the diameters of circular holes have a significant influence on the stress concentration factor of SLGSs and armchair SLGSs show a larger value of stress concentration than zigzag ones.},

abstract = {In contrast to synthetic materials, materials produced by organisms are formed in ambient conditions and with a limited selection of elements. Nevertheless, living organisms reveal elegant strategies for achieving specific functions, ranging from skeletal support to mastication, from sensors and defensive tools to optical function. Using state-of-the-art characterization techniques, we present a biostrategy for strengthening and toughening the otherwise brittle calcite optical lenses found in the brittlestar Ophiocoma wendtii. This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce compressive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinier–Preston zones known in classical metallurgy. We believe that these calcitic nanoparticles, being rich in magnesium, segregate during or just after transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase, similarly to segregation behavior from a supersaturated quenched alloy.},

Therefore, there are several ways to modify them depending on the physical phenomena involved. Recently, it has been demonstrated that surface structure, e.g. artificial patterning, can be used to tune frictional properties. In this paper, we show how the global friction coefficients can also be manipulated using composite surfaces with varying roughness or stiffness values, i.e. by combining geometrical features with the modification of local friction coefficients or stiffnesses. We show that a remarkable reduction of static friction can be achieved by introducing hierarchical arrangements of varying local roughness values, or by introducing controlled material stiffness variations.},

Moreover, higher roughness results in lower dynamic coefficient of friction (COF). Finite element simulations corroborate the experimental measures of COF and let to rationalize the role of material elasticity and surface roughness on the frictional characteristics of soles.

A key characteristic of the high energy absorption of such materials is the large hysteresis during cyclic loading, but its origin remains unknown. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction tests during tensile loading of antler bone showed heterogeneous fibrillar deformation and hysteresis. To explain the origin of these mechanisms from the nanostructure of antler bone, here we develop a class of finite-element fibril models whose predictions are compared to experimental data across a range of potential composite architectures. We demonstrate that the key structural motif enabling a match to experimental data is an axially staggered arrangement of stiff mineralized collagen fibrils coupled with weak, damageable interfibrillar interfaces.},

The fermentation of such microorganisms during the gelling of the silicone matrix results in bionic composites with buckled/collapsed cells that infer, as rationalized with an analytical model and excluded in a abiotic experimental comparison, auxetic properties. During stretching it is found that the Poisson's ratio of such composites changes sign, from negative to positive, and the variation of the electrical resistance is negative. In addition to the conductivity increment, a general increment of the stretchability and damage resistance with respect to the composites prepared by abiotic process is observed. Bionic composites, even if in their infancy, can thus be multifunctional and superior to their traditional/abiotic counterparts.},

The critical penetration energy of monolayer membranes is determined using graphene and the 2D allotrope of boron nitride as case studies. Furthermore, the energy absorption scaling laws with a variable number of layers and interlayer spacing are investigated, for homogeneous or hybrid configurations (alternated stacking of graphene and boron nitride). At the nanolevel, a synergistic interaction between the layers emerges, not observed at the micro- and macro-scale for graphene armors. This size-scale transition in the impact behavior toward higher dimensional scales is rationalized in terms of scaling of the damaged volume and material strength. An optimal number of layers, between 5 and 10, emerges demonstrating that few-layered 2D material armors possess impact strength even higher than their monolayer counterparts. These results provide fundamental understanding for the design of ultralightweight multilayer armors using enhanced 2D material-based nanocomposites.},

abstract = {In recent years, experimental evidences have suggested important direct implications of viscoelasticity of human cells and cell cytoskeleton dynamics on some relevant collective and single-cell behaviors such as migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis. Consequently, the mechanical properties of single cells and how cells respond to mechanical stimuli have been at the center of a vivid debate in the scientific community. By referencing important experimental findings from the literature that have shown that human metastatic tumor cells are approximately 70% softer than benign cells, independently from the cell lines examined, the present authors have very recently theoretically demonstrated that these differences in stiffness might be exploited to mechanically discriminate healthy and cancer cells, for example, through low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound. In particular, by using a generalized viscoelastic paradigm combining classical and fractional derivative-based models, it has been found that selected frequencies (from tens to hundreds of kilohertz) are associated with resonancelike phenomena that are prevailing on thermal fluctuations and hence could be, at least in principle, helpfully utilized for both targeting and selectively attacking tumor cells. With the aim of investigating the effect of the prestress (for instance, induced in protein filaments during cell adhesion) on the overall cell stiffness and, in turn, on its in-frequency response, a simple multiscale scheme is proposed in this paper to bottom-up enrich the spring-pot-based viscoelastic single-cell models by incorporating finite elasticity and thereby determining through sensitivity analyses the role played by the stretched state of the cytoskeletal elements on the cell vibration.},

The uniformly distributed translational and torsional springs along the boundaries are considered to achieve a unified solution for different boundary conditions. To study the vibration characteristics of CNS, total energy including strain energy, kinetic energy, and van der Waals energy are minimized using the Rayleigh-Ritz technique. The first-order shear deformation theory has been utilized to model the shell. Chebyshev polynomials of first kind are used to obtain the eigenvalue matrices. The natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of CNS in different boundary conditions are evaluated. The effect of electric field in axial direction on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of CNS is investigated. The results indicate that, as the electric field increases, the natural frequencies decrease.},

For deriving the strain energy function, Kirchhoff-Love hypotheses are employed. To obtain the solutions, Rayleigh-Ritz technique is implemented by selecting Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials of first kind as admissible displacement functions in three directions. Convergence of the proposed formulation is verified for spiral cylindrical panel and the results are compared with those of ABAQUS. Parametric study is undertaken to highlight the effect of inner radius, separation distance, subtended angle, thickness, and length of the spiral cylinders on the free vibration characteristics. Results obtained in this research are the first step toward modeling spiral cylinders and can be used for comparison in future studies. Finally, the design strategy for the spiral cylinders with specific vibration characteristics is presented.

abstract = {Arc-length methods based on Newton–Raphson (NR) iterative numerical solvers are indispensable in non-linear mechanics to trace the equilibrium curves of systems with snap-back or snap-through behaviours. An example is a crack propagating in a rubber-like solid, which can generate extremely sharp snap-backs when the elastic energy is released. A standard arc-length solver satisfies the arc-length constraint which only limits the increment in displacements and in load level to a fixed amount. Thus, it cannot guarantee the satisfaction of the energy balance in the rate form. This work proposes an arc-length based on the J-integral, and assumes the Griffith balance as a constraint equation. Firstly, a fracture criterion (critical load and direction of crack increment) is formulated, consistent with the thermodynamic principle of maximum dissipation: a crack propagates in the direction of the maximum strain energy release rate. For this purpose, this paper provides an explicit and simple expression of the J-integral for varying angles. This fracture criterion does not require the computation of mixed mode Stress Intensity Factors, or asymptotic solutions or derivatives of the tangent stiffness matrix. By doing so, it is shown that the proposed method easily reconciles with the theory of Configurational Forces. Secondly, because of the explicit expression of J provided in this paper, it is easy to linearize the discretized equations of motions consistently. The method proves able to handle very sudden snap-backs occurring under large strains, and both brittle and ductile crack propagation. A particular example of such behaviour is kirigami (paper-cuts) structures made of graphene. The proposed arc-length can capture, for these structures, the transitions from brittle to ductile crack propagation for the same crack patterns, but different pre-crack lengths.},

In this paper a lamination process was used to transfer graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) on self-adherent Parafilm substrate and we show that a high-strain state of such conductive Parafilm/GNPs film is reversible when the film is transferred by lamination to a fluoroelastomer (FKM) substrate. The stretching of GNP network stuck on viscoelastic Parafilm gave rise to regions of high and low GNP concentrations with increasing the electrical resistance upon stretching. Upon relaxation from a high-strain state, the composite film on FKM substrate maintain the initial electrical conductive state. Finally it was shown the reduction of the ethanol corrosion action in terms of swelling and mechanical performance of the neat FKM when the Parafilm/GNPs film is used for its packaging. In view of the low cost thermoplastic polymer used for the transferring and the lamination method proposed, these findings represent a facile and an industrial scalable approach to realize novel multifunctional elastomer composites.},

In the past, studies have shown how contact splitting is used effectively by animals such as geckos and insects to increase the total peeling line of contacts and therefore the adhesion force. Also, tapering of contacts or grading of their mechanical properties has been shown to be instrumental in the achievement of improved adhesion efficiency. On a more macroscopic scale, structures such as spider web anchorages exploit hierarchical structure or nonlinear constitutive material properties to improve resilience and to achieve tunability in adhesion/detachment characteristics. Here, we analyse some of these properties and propose some mechanisms for the optimization of adhesion that have thus far been neglected in modelling approaches, and could be potentially exploited for the design of bioinspired adhesives. We consider hierarchical structureHierarchical structure, contact taperingContact tapering, gradingGradingof mechanical properties, and their interaction. It emerges that these mechanisms contribute on various size scales to the achievement of optimal adhesive properties through structural complexity and hierarchical organization.},

abstract = {A model for serpentine locomotion is derived from a novel perspective based on concepts from configurational mechanics. The motion is realized through the release of the elastic energy of a deformable rod, sliding inside a frictionless channel, which represents a snake moving against lateral restraints. A new formulation is presented, correcting previous results and including situations never analysed so far, as in the cases when the serpent's body lies only partially inside the restraining channel or when the body has a muscle relaxation localized in a small zone. Micromechanical considerations show that propulsion is the result of reactions tangential to the frictionless constraint and acting on the snake's body, a counter-intuitive feature in mechanics. It is also experimentally demonstrated that the propulsive force driving serpentine motion can be directly measured on a designed apparatus in which flexible bars sweep a frictionless channel. Experiments fully confirm the theoretical modelling, so that the presented results open the way to exploration of effects, such as variability in the bending stiffness or channel geometry or friction, on the propulsive force of snake models made up of elastic rods.},

The lateral shape of these 2D materials is typically considered random and irregular, and their average size is often estimated using techniques characterized by strong approximations or poor statistical significance. Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material.},

Here we develop a new 3D X-ray nanostrain reconstruction method combining analytical modelling of the diffraction signal, fibre-composite theory and in situ deformation, to determine the hitherto unknown nano- and microscale deformation mechanisms in stomatopod tergite cuticle. Stomatopod cuticle at the nanoscale consists of mineralized chitin fibres and calcified protein matrix, which form (at the microscale) plywood (Bouligand) layers with interpenetrating pore-canal fibres. We uncover anisotropic deformation patterns inside Bouligand lamellae, accompanied by load-induced fibre reorientation and pore-canal fibre compression. Lamination theory was used to decouple in-plane fibre reorientation from diffraction intensity changes induced by 3D lamellae tilting. Our method enables separation of deformation dynamics at multiple hierarchical levels, a critical consideration in the cooperative mechanics characteristic of biological and bioinspired materials. The nanostrain reconstruction technique is general, depending only on molecular-level fibre symmetry and can be applied to the in situ dynamics of advanced nanostructured materials with 3D hierarchical design.},

abstract = {In this work we compare Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron-transport properties with reflection electron energy-loss measurements in diamond and graphite films. We assess the impact of different approximations of the dielectric response on the observables of interest for the characterization of carbon-based materials. We calculate the frequency-dependent dielectric response and energy-loss functions of these materials in two ways: a full ab initio approach, in which we carry out time-dependent density functional simulations in linear response for different momentum transfers, and a semi-classical model, based on the Drude–Lorentz extension to finite momenta of the optical dielectric function. Ab initio calculated dielectric functions lead to better agreement with measured energy-loss spectra compared to the widely used Drude–Lorentz model. This discrepancy is particularly evident for insulators and semiconductors beyond the optical limit (q≠0), where single-particle excitations become relevant. Furthermore, we show that the behaviour of the energy-loss function obtained at different accuracy levels has a dramatic effect on other physical observables, such as the inelastic mean free path and the stopping power in the low energy (<100 eV) regime and thus on the accuracy of MC simulations.},

Here, we have investigated the mechanical properties and fracture patterns of a large number of GNW of different shapes and sizes using fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the GNW mechanical properties are strongly dependent on its shape and size and, as a general trend narrow sheets have larger ultimate strength and Young's modulus than wide ones. The estimated Young's modulus values were found to be in a range of ≈100−1000 GPa and the ultimate strength in a range of ≈20−110 GPa, depending on GNW shape.

abstract = {Very recently, a Weibull-based probabilistic strategy has been successfully applied to bundles of wires to determine their overall stress-strain behaviour, also capturing previously unpredicted nonlinear and post-elastic features of hierarchical strands. This approach is based on the so-called “Equal Load Sharing (ELS)” hypothesis by virtue of which, when a wire breaks, the load acting on the strand is homogeneously redistributed among the surviving wires. Despite the overall effectiveness of the method, some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and in silico Finite Element-based simulations or experimental findings might arise when more complex structures are analysed, e.g. helically arranged bundles. To overcome these limitations, an enhanced hybrid approach is proposed in which the probability of rupture is combined with a deterministic mechanical model of a strand constituted by helically-arranged and hierarchically-organized wires. The analytical model is validated comparing its predictions with both Finite Element simulations and experimental tests. The results show that generalized stress-strain responses - incorporating tension/torsion coupling - are naturally found and, once one or more elements break, the competition between geometry and mechanics of the strand microstructure, i.e. the different cross sections and helical angles of the wires in the different hierarchical levels of the strand, determines the no longer homogeneous stress redistribution among the surviving wires whose fate is hence governed by a “Hierarchical Load Sharing” criterion.},

abstract = {Biomimetics has introduced a new paradigm: by constructing structures with engineered materials and geometries, innovative devices may be fabricated. According to this paradigm, both shape and material properties are equally important to determine functional performance. This idea has been applied also in the field of the microfabrication of smart surfaces, exploiting properties already worked out by nature, like in the case of self-cleaning, drag reduction, structural coloration, and dry adhesion. Regarding dry adhesive properties, geckos represent a good example from which we take inspiration, since they have the extraordinary ability to climb almost every type of surface, even smooth ones, thanks to the hierarchical conformation of the fibrillary setae in their toe pads. Due to this design, they can increase the area of contact with a surface and thus the amount of attractive van der Waals forces. While reproducing with artificial materials the same functional morphology of gecko's pads is typically not achievable with traditional microfabrication techniques, recently Direct Laser Litography offered new opportunities to fabrication of complex three-dimensional structures in the microscale with nanometric resolution. Using direct laser lithography, we have fabricated artificial gecko setae, reproducing with unprecedented faithfulness the natural morphology in the same dimensional scale. Adhesion force of artificial setae toward different surfaces have been tested in dry condition by means of a dedicated setup and compared with natural ones.},

abstract = {We consider the mechanical motion of a system of six macroscopic pendula which are connected with springs and arranged in a hexagonal geometry. When the springs are pre-tensioned, the coupling between neighbouring pendula along the longitudinal (L) and the transverse (T) directions are different: identifying the motion along the L and T directions as the two components of a spin-like degree of freedom, we theoretically and experimentally verify that the pre-tensioned springs result in a tunable spin-orbit coupling. We elucidate the structure of such a spin-orbit coupling in the extended two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, making connections to physics of graphene. The experimental frequencies and the oscillation patterns of the eigenmodes for the hexagonal ring of pendula are extracted from a spectral analysis of the motion of the pendula in response to an external excitation and are found to be in good agreement with our theoretical predictions. We anticipate that extending this classical analogue of quantum mechanical spin-orbit coupling to two-dimensional lattices will lead to exciting new topological phenomena in classical mechanics.},

The results showed that the theoretical predictions of the ring deformation and strain energy matched the FE results very well, and that the ring deformations were comparable to the topological experiment. Moreover, no matter whether the ring was compressed or tensioned by N-pairs of forces, the ring always tended to be regular polygons with 2N sides as the force increased, and a proper compressive force deformed the ring into exquisite flower-like patterns.

In particular, the mechanical properties of these novel architectures are investigated in both compressive and tensile regimes, a number of truss geometries by straining along different directions. Our atomistic simulations reveal a similar behavior under tensile stress for all the samples. Conversely, under compressive regimes the emergence of a response that depends on the orientation of load is observed together with a peculiar local instability. Due to this instability, some of these nanotruss networks present a negative Poisson ratio in compression, like re-entrant foams. Finally, the performance of these nanotruss networks is analyzed with regards to their use as impact energy absorbers, displaying properties that outperform materials traditionally used in these applications.},

abstract = {Various strategies have been proposed in recent years in the field of mechanical metamaterials to widen band gaps emerging due to either Bragg scattering or to local resonance effects. One of these is to exploit coupled Bragg and local resonance band gaps. This effect has been theoretically studied and experimentally demonstrated in the past for two- and three-phase mechanical metamaterials, which are usually complicated in structure and suffer from the drawback of difficult practical implementation. To avoid this problem, we theoretically analyze for the first time a single-phase solid metamaterial with so-called quasi-resonant Bragg band gaps. We show evidence that the latter are achieved by obtaining an overlap of the Bragg band gap with local resonance modes of the matrix material, instead of the inclusion. This strategy appears to provide wide and stable band gaps with almost unchanged width and frequencies for varying inclusion dimensions. The conditions of existence of these band gaps are characterized in detail using metamaterial models. Wave attenuation mechanisms are also studied and transmission analysis confirms efficient wave filtering performance. Mechanical metamaterials with quasi-resonant Bragg band gaps may thus be used to guide the design of practically oriented metamaterials for a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {Carbon-based three-dimensional aerographite networks, built from interconnected hollow tubular tetrapods of multilayer graphene, are ultra-lightweight materials recently discovered and ideal for advanced multifunctional applications. In order to predict the bulk mechanical behaviour of networks it is very important to understand the mechanics of their individual building blocks. Here we characterize the mechanical response of single aerographite tetrapods via in situ scanning electron and atomic force microscopy measurements. To understand the acquired results, which show that the overall behaviour of the tetrapod is governed by the buckling of the central joint, a mechanical nonlinear model was developed, introducing the concept of the buckling hinge. Finite element method simulations elucidate the governing buckling phenomena. The results are then generalized for tetrapods of different size-scales and shapes. These basic findings will permit better understanding of the mechanical response of the related networks and the design of similar aerogels based on graphene and other two-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {A primary issue in biomaterials science is to design materials with ad hoc properties, depending on the specific application. Among these properties, friction is recognized as a fundamental aspect characterizing materials for many practical purposes. Recently, new and unexpected frictional properties have been obtained by exploiting hierarchical multiscale structures, inspired by those observed in many biological systems. In order to understand the emergent frictional behavior of these materials at the macroscale, it is fundamental to investigate their hierarchical structure, spanning across different length scales. In this article, we introduce a statistical multiscale approach, based on a one-dimensional formulation of the spring-block model, in which friction is modeled at each hierarchical scale through the classical Amontons-Coulomb force with statistical dispersion on the friction coefficients of the microscopic components. By means of numerical simulations, we deduce the global statistical distributions of the elementary structure at micrometric scale and use them as input distributions for the simulations at the next scale levels. We thus study the influence of microscopic artificial patterning on macroscopic friction coefficients. We show that it is possible to tune the friction properties of a hierarchical surface and provide some insight on the mechanisms involved at different length scales.},

Applied forces may cause deformation by folding, buckling, bending, and tearing of these defective sites of graphene, which lead to a remarkable decline in normal and friction load bearing capacity. In this work, we experimentally quantified the maximum sustainable normal and friction forces, corresponding to the damage thresholds of the different investigated defects as well as their pull-out (adhesion) forces. Horizontal wrinkles (with respect to the basal plane, i.e., folded) sustained the highest normal load, up to 317 nN, during sliding, whereas for vertical (i.e., standing) wrinkles, step-edges, and edges, the load bearing capacities are up to 113, 74, and 63 nN, respectively. The related deformation mechanisms were also experimentally investigated by varying the normal load up to the initiation of the damage from the defects and extended with the numerical results from molecular dynamics and finite element method simulations.},

abstract = {The intrinsic properties of nanomaterials offer promise for technological revolutions in many fields, including transportation, soft robotics, and energy. Unfortunately, the exploitation of such properties in polymer nanocomposites is extremely challenging due to the lack of viable dispersion routes when the filler content is high. We usually face a dichotomy between the degree of nanofiller loading and the degree of dispersion (and, thus, performance) because dispersion quality decreases with loading. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable pressing-and-folding method (P & F), inspired by the art of croissant-making, to efficiently disperse ultrahigh loadings of nanofillers in polymer matrices. A desired nanofiller dispersion can be achieved simply by selecting a sufficient number of P & F cycles. Because of the fine microstructural control enabled by P & F, mechanical reinforcements close to the theoretical maximum and independent of nanofiller loading (up to 74 vol %) were obtained. We propose a universal model for the P & F dispersion process that is parametrized on an experimentally quantifiable "D factor". The model represents a general guideline for the optimization of nanocomposites with enhanced functionalities including sensing, heat management, and energy storage.},

However, modelling of adhesion, such as in single or multiple peeling theories, has in most cases been limited to ideal cases, and due consideration of the role of substrate geometry and mechanical properties has been limited. In this paper, we propose a numerical model to evaluate these effects, including substrate roughness, patterning, curvature, and deformability. The approach is validated by comparing its predictions with classical thin film peeling theoretical results, and is then used to predict the effects of substrate properties. These results can provide deeper insight into experiments, and the developed model can be a useful tool to design and optimize artificial adhesives with tailor-made characteristics.},

abstract = {Control of low-frequency sound is a challenge, despite numerous advances in the field. Recently emerged acoustic metamaterials have already proven their efficiency for the development of innovative systems for sound control and demonstration of such fascinating phenomena as super-resolution imaging, transformation acoustics, acoustic cloaking, etc. For sound attenuation, a common attenuation mechanism relies on dispersion induced by local resonances that results in the generation of slow sound inside a metastructure at resonant frequencies. However, the selective bandwidth of metamaterials with identical resonators restricts their practical applications. To overcome this limitation, one can introduce rainbow-type resonators that leads to the increase of structural sizes and raises manufacturing costs. We present fractal and bio-inspired labyrinthine acoustic metamaterials with non-resonant elements for low-frequency sound control. Designed configurations contain sets of narrow channels extending wave propagation paths that leads to reduction of effective sound speed within a structure. We show that by folding these channels into fractal space-filling curves or bio-inspired geometries, one can induce strong artificial Mie-type resonances that allow the achievement of total broadband sound reflection at deep subwavelength scales. This unique phenomenon can be used to develop small-size metastructures with total reflectance of low-frequency sound for versatile applications.},

Recent experimental and computational investigations on the behavior of graphene under impact conditions revealed exceptional energy absorption properties as well. However, the reported numerical and experimental values differ by an order of magnitude. In this work, we combined numerical and analytical modeling to address this issue. In the numerical part, we employed reactive molecular dynamics to carry out ballistic tests on single, double, and triple-layered graphene sheets. We used velocity values within the range tested in experiments. Our numerical and the experimental results were used to determine parameters for a scaling law. We find that the specific penetration energy decreases as the number of layers (N) increases, from {\^{a}}15 MJ/kg for N = 1 to {\^{a}}0.9 MJ/kg for N = 350, for an impact velocity of 900 m/s. These values are in good agreement with simulations and experiments, within the entire range of N values for which data is presently available. Scale effects explain the apparent discrepancy between simulations and experiments.},

Some of these cuticles have an optimal combination of lightweight and good mechanical properties, and have inspired the design of composites with novel microstructures. Among these, beetle elytra have been explored extensively for their multilayered structure, multifunctional roles and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the bending properties of elytra by simulating their natural loading condition and comparing it with other loading configurations. Further, we examined the properties of their constitutive bulk layers to understand the contribution of each one to the overall mechanical behaviour. Our results showed that elytra are graded, multilayered composite structures that perform better in natural loading direction in terms of both flexural modulus and strength which is likely an adaptation to withstand loads encountered in the habitat. Experiments are supported by analytical calculations and finite element method modelling, which highlighted the additional role of the relatively stiff external exocuticle and of the flexible thin bottom layer in enhancing flexural mechanical properties. Such studies contribute to the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of this natural composite material and to the development of novel bioinspired multifunctional composites and for optimized armours.},

abstract = {Preservation of acellular matrices represents a big challenge for the improvement of tissue engineering. In this work, a new method to preserve over time a decellularized esophageal scaffolds was explored. Dried and sterile acellular esophagi were obtained with a combined treatment of ethanol and a subsequent supercritical CO2 drying. Preservation of the extracellular matrix architecture, collagen content, and mechanical properties up to 6 months demonstrated the efficiency of the methodology with implications in natural scaffold storage. In vitro support of mesenchymal stem cells showed a promising indication to the further use of the technology in pre-clinical and clinical application.},

abstract = {Spiders can produce different types of silk for a variety of purposes, such as making webs for capturing prey, sheets for wrapping, anchorages for connecting threads to surfaces, nest-building, cocoons for protecting eggs, dragline for safe locomotion and ballooning. An additional mechanism, only recently video recorded and never discussed in the literature, is spider weight lifting. Of conceptual importance comparable to that of other key spider mechanisms such as ballooning, spider weight lifting—preceded by a dragging phase for vertical alignment of weight and anchorage—is studied here. It emerges as a smart technique, allowing a single spider to lift weights in principle of any entity just using a tiny pre-stress of the silk. Such a pre-stress already occurs naturally with the weight of the spider itself when it is suspended from a thread. Large deformations, high ultimate strain, nonlinear stiffening, re-tensioning of the silk fibers and extra height of the anchoring points are all characteristics of empirical spider silk and of this lifting technique. It will be demonstrated that they all help to increase the efficiency of the mechanism. Toy experiments inspired by the spider lifting are finally proposed and compared with the theory.},

Here we report a protein-mediated mineralization process that takes advantage of disorder-order interplay using elastin-like recombinamers to program organic-inorganic interactions into hierarchically ordered mineralized structures. The materials comprise elongated apatite nanocrystals that are aligned and organized into microscopic prisms, which grow together into spherulite-like structures hundreds of micrometers in diameter that come together to fill macroscopic areas. The structures can be grown over large uneven surfaces and native tissues as acid-resistant membranes or coatings with tuneable hierarchy, stiffness, and hardness. Our study represents a potential strategy for complex materials design that may open opportunities for hard tissue repair and provide insights into the role of molecular disorder in human physiology and pathology.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a realistic model of nanometer-thick SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires (NWs) using a combined first-principles and experimental approach. SiC/SiOx core/shell NWs were first synthesised by a low-cost carbothermal method and their chemical-physical experimental analysis was accomplished by recording X-ray absorption near-edge spectra. In particular, the K-edge absorption lineshapes of C, O, and Si are used to validate our computational model of the SiC/SiOx core/shell NW architectures, obtained by a multiscale approach, including molecular dynamics, tight-binding and density functional simulations. Moreover, we present ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of hydrogenated SiC and SiC/SiOx core/shell NWs, studying the modification induced by several different substitutional defects and impurities into both the surface and the interfacial region between the SiC core and the SiOx shell. We find that on the one hand the electron quantum confinement results in a broadening of the band gap, while hydroxyl surface terminations decrease it. This computational investigation shows that our model of SiC/SiOx core/shell NWs is capable to deliver an accurate interpretation of the recorded X-ray absorption near-edge spectra and proves to be a valuable tool towards the optimal design and application of these nanosystems in actual devices.},

abstract = {Cellular structures having the internal volumes of the cells filled with fluids, fibres or other bulk materials are very common in nature. A remarkable example of composite solution is the hygroscopic keel tissue of the ice plant Delosperma nakurense. This tissue, specialized in promoting the mechanism for seed dispersal, reveals a cellular structure composed by elongated cells filled with a cellulosic swelling material. Upon hydrating, the filler adsorbs large amounts of water leading to a change in the cells' shape and effective stiffness. This paper, inspired by the configuration of the aforementioned hygroscopic keel tissue, deals with the analysis of a two-dimensional honeycomb made of elongated hexagonal cells filled with an elastic material. The system is treated as a sequence of Euler–Bernoulli beams on Winkler foundation, whose displacements are derived by introducing the classical shape functions of the Finite Element Method. The assumption of the Born rule, in conjunction with an energy-based approach, provide the constitutive model in the continuum form. It emerges a strong influence of the infill's stiffness and cell walls' inclination on the macroscopic elastic constants. In particular, parametric analysis reveals the system isotropy only in the particular case of regular hexagonal microstructure. Even though a rigorous analysis of the keel tissue is well beyond our aim, the application of the theoretical model to estimate the effective stiffness of such biological system leads to results that are in good agreement with the published data, where the keel tissue is represented as an internally pressurized honeycomb. Specifically, an energetic equivalence gives an explicit relation between the inner pressure and the filler's stiffness. Optimal values of pressure and cell walls' inclination also emerge. Finally, the theory is extended to the hierarchical configuration and a closed form expression for the macroscopic elastic moduli is provided. It emerges a synergy of hierarchy and material heterogeneity in obtaining a stiffer material, in addition to an optimal number of hierarchical levels.},

abstract = {Graphene foams have recently attracted a great deal of interest for their possible use in technological applications, such as electrochemical storage devices, wearable electronics, and chemical sensing. In this work, we present computational investigations, performed by using molecular dynamics with reactive potentials, of the mechanical and thermal properties of graphene random nanofoams. In particular, we assess the mechanical and thermal performances of four families of random foams characterized by increasing mass density and decreasing average pore size. We find that the foams' mechanical performances under tension cannot be rationalized in terms of mass density, while they are principally related to their topology. Under compression, higher-density foams show the typical slope change in the stress–strain curve at 5−10% strain, moving from linear elasticity to a buckling region. At variance, lower density foams display a quasi-linear behavior up to 35% strain. Furthermore, we assess the thermal conductivity of these random foams using the Green–Kubo approach. While foam thermal conductivity is affected by both connectivity and defects, nevertheless we obtain similar values for all the investigated families, which means that topology is the critical factor affecting thermal transport in these structures.},

abstract = {Bioinspiration can lead to exceptional mechanical properties in a number of biological materials as a result of their internal structure. In particular, the hierarchical arrangement of nano-to macro-components can bring to complex energy dissipation mechanisms and unprecedented resistance to crack growth. In this work, we propose to exploit this approach, combining in a multiscale composite structure carbon nanotubes with conventional carbon fibre reinforcements in a polyvinyl butyral matrix. We show that grafting the nanotubes onto the carbon microfibres improves their interface properties with the matrix considerably, effectively doubling their apparent strength. At the same time, the addition of nanotubes to microfibre reinforcements helps to improve the composite toughness, reaching more than twice the value for the conventional, non-hierarchically reinforced composite. Numerical simulations and fracture mechanics considerations are also provided to interpret the results.},

abstract = {We numerically analyze the performance of labyrinthine acoustic metamaterials with internal channels folded along a Wunderlich space-filling curve to control low-frequency sound in air. In contrast to previous studies, we perform direct modeling of wave propagation through folded channels without introducing effective theory assumptions. We reveal that metastructures with channels that allow wave propagation in the opposite direction to incident waves, have different dynamics as compared to those for straight slits of equivalent length. These differences are attributed to tortuosity effects and result in 100% wave reflection at band gap frequencies. This total reflection phenomenon is found to be insensitive to thermo-viscous dissipation in air. For labyrinthine channels generated by recursive iteration levels, one can achieve broadband total sound reflection by using a metamaterial monolayer, and efficiently control the amount of absorbed wave energy by tuning the channel width. Thus, the work contributes to a better understanding of labyrinthine metamaterials with potential applications for reflection and filtering of low-frequency airborne sound.},

The key structural features of silk made of stiff nanocrystals, including hydrogen bonded $\beta$-strands and $\beta$-sheet nanocrystals, when embedded in a softer matrix demonstrate that the tensile strength as well as the stiffness of the composites are higher than those measured for SR reinforced with synthetic polyether-ether-ketone fibers.

A chemical reduction of graphene oxide by exposure to hydrazine hydrate at 100 °C significantly changes the interfacial interaction with the substrate as well as the tribology. Spectroscopic techniques like Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that the treatment with hydrazine replaces oxygen functional groups and also induces roughness, a structural disorder and decreases the interlayer separation in the transition from graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Treatment with hydrazine reduces adhesion and friction force against diamond like carbon coated Si probe (DLC AFM) at the basal plain of the coatings. Investigation at the edges revealed that the presence of oxygenic functional groups leads to higher shear strength with glass-fibre and polystyrene which reduces after treatment with hydrazine.},

abstract = {In many biological structures, optimized mechanical properties are obtained through complex structural organization involving multiple constituents, functional grading and hierarchical organization. In the case of biological surfaces, the possibility to modify the frictional and adhesive behaviour can also be achieved by exploiting a grading of the material properties. In this paper, we investigate this possibility by considering the frictional sliding of elastic surfaces in the presence of a spatial variation of the Young's modulus and the local friction coefficients. Using finite-element simulations and a two-dimensional spring-block model, we investigate how graded material properties affect the macroscopic frictional behaviour, in particular, static friction values and the transition from static to dynamic friction. The results suggest that the graded material properties can be exploited to reduce static friction with respect to the corresponding non-graded material and to tune it to desired values, opening possibilities for the design of bioinspired surfaces with tailor-made tribological properties.},

abstract = {A folding technique is reported to incorporate large-area monolayer graphene films in polymer composites for mechanical reinforcement. Compared with the classic stacking method, the folding strategy results in further stiffening, strengthening, and toughening of the composite. By using a water–air-interface-facilitated procedure, an A5-size 400 nm thin polycarbonate (PC) film is folded in half 10 times to a ≈0.4 mm thick material (1024 layers). A large PC/graphene film is also folded by the same process, resulting in a composite with graphene distributed uniformly. A three-point bending test is performed to study the mechanical performance of the composites. With a low volume fraction of graphene (0.085%), the Young's modulus, strength, and toughness modulus are enhanced in the folded composite by an average of 73.5%, 73.2%, and 59.1%, respectively, versus the pristine stacked polymer films, or 40.2%, 38.5%, and 37.3% versus the folded polymer film, proving a remarkable mechanical reinforcement from the combined folding and reinforcement of graphene. These results are rationalized with combined theoretical and computational analyses, which also allow the synergistic behavior between the reinforcement and folding to be quantified. The folding approach could be extended/applied to other 2D nanomaterials to design and make macroscale laminated composites with enhanced mechanical properties.},

abstract = {The quest for large and low-frequency band gaps is one of the principal objectives pursued in a number of engineering applications, ranging from noise absorption to vibration control, and to seismic wave abatement. For this purpose, a plethora of complex architectures (including multiphase materials) and multiphysics approaches have been proposed in the past, often involving difficulties in their practical realization. To address the issue of proposing a material design that enables large band gaps using a simple configuration, in this study we propose an easy-to-manufacture design able to open large, low-frequency complete Lamb band gaps exploiting a suitable arrangement of masses and stiffnesses produced by cavities in a monolithic material. The performance of the designed structure is evaluated by numerical simulations and confirmed by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) measurements on an isotropic polyvinyl chloride plate in which a square ring region of cross-like cavities is fabricated. The full wave field reconstruction clearly confirms the ability of even a limited number of unit cell rows of the proposed design to efficiently attenuate Lamb waves. In addition, numerical simulations show that the structure allows to shift the central frequency of the BG through geometrical modifications. The design may be of interest for applications in which large BGs at low frequencies are required.},

abstract = {Plants use many strategies to move efficiently in soil, such as growth from the tip, tropic movements, and morphological changes. In this paper, we propose a method to translate morphological features of Zea mays roots into a new design of soft robots that will be able to move in soil. The method relies on image processing and curve fitting techniques to extract the profile of Z. mays primary root. We implemented an analytic translation of the root profile in a 3D model (CAD) to fabricate root-like probes by means of 3D printing technology. Then, we carried out a comparative analysis among the artificial root-like probe and probes with different tip shapes (cylindrical, conical, elliptical, and parabolic) and diameters (11, 9, 7, 5, and 3 mm). The results showed that the energy consumption and the penetration force of the bioinspired probe are better with respect to the other shapes for all the diameters of the developed probes. For 100 mm of penetration depth and 7 mm of probe diameter, the energy consumption of the bioinspired probe is 89% lesser with respect to the cylindrical probe and 26% lesser with respect to the conical probe. The penetration performance of the considered tip shapes was evaluated also by means of numerical simulations, obtaining a good agreement with the experimental results. Additional investigations on plant root morphology, movement strategies, and material properties can allow the development of innovative bioinspired solutions exploitable in challenging environments. This research can bring to breakthrough scenarios in different fields, such as exploration tasks, environmental monitoring, geotechnical studies, and medical applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, a periodic configuration of V-shaped double peeling process is investigated. Specifically, an elastic thin film is detached from a soft elastic material by applying multiple concentrated loads periodically distributed with spatial periodicity $\lambda$. The original Kendall's idea is extended to take into account the change in elastic energy occurring in the substrate when the detachment fronts propagate. The symmetric configuration typical of a V-peeling process causes the energy release rate to be sensitive to variations of the elastic energy stored in the soft substrate. This results in an enhancement of the adhesion strength because part of the external work required to trigger the peeling mechanism is converted in substrate elastic energy. A key role is played by both spatial periodicity $\lambda$ and elasticity ratio E/Eh, between tape and substrate elastic moduli, in determining the conditions of stable adhesion. Indeed, the presence of multiple peeling fronts determines a modification of the mechanism of interaction, because deformations close to each peeling front are also affected by the stresses related to the other fronts. Results show that the energy release rate depends on the detached length of the tape so that conditions can be established which lead to an increase of the supported load compared to the classical peeling on rigid substrates. Finally, we also find that for any given value of the load per unit length, an optimum value of the wavelength $\lambda$ exists that maximizes the tolerance of the system, before unstable propagation of the peeling front can occur.},

abstract = {Regenerated silk (RS) is a protein-based “biopolymer” that enables the design of new materials; here, we called “bionic” the process of regenerated silk production by a fermentation-assisted method. Based on yeast's fermentation, here we produced a living hybrid composite made of regenerated silk nanofibrils and a single-cell fungi, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast extract, by fermentation of such microorganisms at room temperature in a dissolution bath of silkworm silk fibers. The fermentation-based processing enhances the beta-sheet content of the RS, corresponding to a reduction in water permeability and CO2 diffusion through RS/yeast thin films enabling the fabrication of a mechanically robust film that enhances food storage durability. Finally, a transfer print method, which consists of transferring RS and RS/yeast film layers onto a self-adherent paraffin substrate, was used for the realization of heat-responsive wrinkles by exploiting the high thermal expansion of the paraffin substrate that regulates the applied strain, resulting in a switchable coating morphology from the wrinkle-free state to a wrinkled state if the food temperature overcomes a designed threshold. We envision that such efficient and smart coatings can be applied for the realization of smart packaging that, through such a temperature-sensing mechanism, can be used to control food storage conditions.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a theoretical and computational model for taking into account the anisotropic structure of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) in the Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport. In particular, the dielectric characteristics, such as the inelastic mean free path and energy losses, are treated by linearly combining the contributions to these observables along the two main orthogonal directions identifying the layered crystalline structure of HOPG (along the layer plane and perpendicular to it). Energy losses are evaluated from ab initio calculations of the dielectric function of the system along these two perpendicular directions. Monte Carlo simulated spectra, obtained with our anisotropic approach, are compared with acquired experimental data of reflection electron energy loss and secondary electron spectra, showing a good agreement. These findings validate the idea of the importance of considering properly weighted interplanar and intraplanar interactions in the simulation of electron transport in layered materials.},

abstract = {Contact unit size reduction is a widely studied mechanism as a means to improve adhesion in natural fibrillar systems, such as those observed in beetles or geckos. However, these animals also display complex structural features in the way the contact is subdivided in a hierarchical manner. Here, we study the influence of hierarchical fibrillar architectures on the load distribution over the contact elements of the adhesive system, and the corresponding delamination behaviour. We present an analytical model to derive the load distribution in a fibrillar system loaded in shear, including hierarchical splitting of contacts, i.e. a “hierarchical shear-lag” model that generalizes the well-known shear-lag model used in mechanics. The influence on the detachment process is investigated introducing a numerical procedure that allows the derivation of the maximum delamination force as a function of the considered geometry, including statistical variability of local adhesive energy. Our study suggests that contact splitting generates improved adhesion only in the ideal case of extremely compliant contacts. In real cases, to produce efficient adhesive performance, contact splitting needs to be coupled with hierarchical architectures to counterbalance high load concentrations resulting from contact unit size reduction, generating multiple delamination fronts and helping to avoid detrimental non-uniform load distributions. We show that these results can be summarized in a generalized adhesion scaling scheme for hierarchical structures, proving the beneficial effect of multiple hierarchical levels. The model can thus be used to predict the adhesive performance of hierarchical adhesive structures, as well as the mechanical behaviour of composite materials with hierarchical reinforcements.},

However, contaminants are usually trapped between the layers, aggregating into randomly located blisters, incompatible with scalable fabrication processes. Here we report a process to remove blisters from fully formed heterostructures. Our method is over an order of magnitude faster than those previously reported and allows multiple interfaces to be cleaned simultaneously. We fabricate blister-free regions of graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride with an area $\sim$ 5000 $\mu$m 2 , achieving mobilities up to 180,000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, and 1.8 × 10 6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 9 K. We also assemble heterostructures using graphene intentionally exposed to polymers and solvents. After cleaning, these samples reach similar mobilities. This demonstrates that exposure of graphene to process-related contaminants is compatible with the realization of high mobility samples, paving the way to the development of wafer-scale processes for the integration of layered materials in (opto)electronic devices.},

abstract = {The double peeling of detachment of non-linear adhesive tapes from a flat Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surface has been investigated from both experimental and theoretical point of view. Double peeling tests show that, as the detachment process advances, the peeling angle stabilizes on a limiting value $\theta$lim corresponding to a critical pull-off force Fc above which the tape is completely detached from the substrate. This observed behavior is in good agreement with results obtained following the new theory of multiple peeling and taking into account the hardening-softening non-linear behavior of the experimentally tested adhesive tapes and clarifies some aspects of the experimental data. In particular, the theoretical model shows that the value of the limiting peeling angle depends on the geometry of the adhesive tape as well as on the stiffness properties and on the interfacial energy ∆$\gamma$. Finally, theoretical predictions confirm that solutions with a peeling angle lower than $\theta$lim are unstable.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Optical Society of America. In this work, we analyze the role of strain on a set of silicon racetrack resonators presenting di erent orientations with respect to the applied strain. The strain induces a variation of the resonance wavelength, caused by the photoelastic variation of the material refractive index as well as by the mechanical deformation of the device. In particular, the mechanical deformation alters both the resonator perimeter and the waveguide cross-section. Finite element simulations taking into account all these e ects are presented, providing good agreement with experimental results. By studying the role of the resonator orientation we identify interesting features, such as the tuning of the resonance shift from negative to positive values and the possibility of realizing strain insensitive devices.},

abstract = {Implantation of biodegradable scaffold is considered as a promising method to treat bone disorders, but knowledge of the dynamic bone repair process is extremely limited. In this study, based on the representative volume cell of a periodic scaffold, the influence of rehabilitation exercise duration per day on the bone repair was investigated by a computational framework. The framework coupled scaffold degradation and bone remodeling. The scaffold degradation was described by a function of stochastic hydrolysis independent of mechanical stimulation, and the bone formation was remodeled by a function of the mechanical stimulation, i.e., strain energy density. Then, numerical simulations were performed to study the dynamic bone repair process. The results showed that the scaffold degradation and the bone formation in the process were competitive. An optimal exercise duration per day emerged. All exercise durations promoted the bone maturation with a final Young's modulus of 1.9 ± 0.3 GPa. The present study connects clinical rehabilitation and fundamental research, and is helpful to understand the bone repair process and further design bone scaffold for bone tissue engineering.},

However, finding a reliable and robust power source to operate these devices, particularly in off-the-grid, maintenance-free applications, still poses a great challenge. The exploitation of ubiquitous temperature gradients, as the source of energy, can become a practical solution, since the recent discovery of the outstanding thermoelectric properties of a conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Unfortunately the use of PEDOT:PSS is currently constrained by its brittleness and limited processability. Herein, PEDOT:PSS is blended with a commercial elastomeric polyurethane (Lycra), to obtain tough and processable self-standing films. A remarkable strain-at-break of ≈700% is achieved for blends with 90 wt% Lycra, after ethylene glycol treatment, without affecting the Seebeck voltage. For the first time the viability of these novel blends as stretchable self-powered sensors is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is a major secondary form of osteoporosis, with the fracture risk significantly elevated – at similar levels of bone mineral density – in patients taking glucocorticoids compared with non-users. The adverse bone structural changes at multiple hierarchical levels in GIOP, and their mechanistic consequences leading to reduced load-bearing capacity, are not clearly understood. Here we combine experimental X-ray nanoscale mechanical imaging with analytical modelling of the bone matrix mechanics to determine mechanisms causing bone material quality deterioration during development of GIOP. In situ synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction combined with tensile testing was used to measure nanoscale deformation mechanisms in a murine model of GIOP, due to a corticotrophin-releasing hormone promoter mutation, at multiple ages (8-, 12-, 24- and 36 weeks), complemented by quantitative micro-computed tomography and backscattered electron imaging to determine mineral concentrations. We develop a two-level hierarchical model of the bone matrix (mineralized fibril and lamella) to predict fibrillar mechanical response as a function of architectural parameters of the mineralized matrix. The fibrillar elastic modulus of GIOP-bone is lower than healthy bone throughout development, and nearly constant in time, in contrast to the progressively increasing stiffness in healthy bone. The lower mineral platelet aspect ratio value for GIOP compared to healthy bone in the multiscale model can explain the fibrillar deformation. Consistent with this result, independent measurement of mineral platelet lengths from wide-angle X-ray diffraction finds a shorter mineral platelet length in GIOP. Our results show how lowered mineralization combined with altered mineral nanostructure in GIOP leads to lowered mechanical competence. Significance Statement: Increased fragility in musculoskeletal disorders like osteoporosis are believed to arise due to alterations in bone structure at multiple length-scales from the organ down to the supramolecular-level, where collagen molecules and elongated mineral nanoparticles form stiff fibrils. However, the nature of these molecular-level alterations are not known. Here we used X-ray scattering to determine both how bone fibrils deform in secondary osteoporosis, as well as how the fibril orientation and mineral nanoparticle structure changes. We found that osteoporotic fibrils become less stiff both because the mineral nanoparticles became shorter and less efficient at transferring load from collagen, and because the fibrils are more randomly oriented. These results will help in the design of new composite musculoskeletal implants for bone repair.},

abstract = {A simple procedure of producing three-dimensional blisters of graphene through irradiation of the visible range laser by Raman spectrometer has been presented. Fabrication of different volumes of the blisters and their characterization were carried out with Raman spectroscopy by tuning the irradiation dose. The produced blisters showed a consistency in altitude and a remarkable change in functionality, adhesion force map and local contact potential difference as compared to untreated monolayer graphene and naturally occurred graphene nanobubbles. Nevertheless, bilayer graphene is unaffected in the applied laser doses. The laser irradiation led to lattice expansion of carbon atoms and introduced oxygenic functional groups with the structural disorder. The internal pressure of the gaseous molecules was evaluated by monitoring the shape of the graphene blisters and nanobubbles. High-resolution Raman mapping showed the impact of laser-affected area and the defect density (nd) is reported as a function of displacement. Our results reveal ease of applicability of the Raman laser for the imaging and texturing of graphene pointing toward the possibility of the desirable and cost-effective laser writing at the submicron scale by tuning photochemistry of graphene which is pivotal for numerous applications.},

abstract = {The regeneration of dental tissues is a still an unmet clinical need; in fact, no therapies have been completely successful in regenerating dental tissue complexes such as periodontium, which is also due to the lack of scaffolds that are able to guide and direct cell fate towards the reconstruction of different mineralized and non-mineralized dental tissues. In this respect, the present work develops a novel multifunctional hybrid scaffold recapitulating the different features of alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, and cementum by integrating the biomineralization process, and tape casting and electrospinning techniques. The scaffold is endowed with a superparamagnetic ability, thanks to the use of a biocompatible, bioactive superparamagnetic apatite phase, as a mineral component that is able to promote osteogenesis and to be activated by remote magnetic signals. The periodontal scaffold was obtained by engineering three different layers, recapitulating the relevant compositional and microstructural features of the target tissues, into a monolithic multifunctional graded device. Physico-chemical, morphological, and ultrastructural analyses, in association with preliminary in vitro investigations carried out with mesenchymal stem cells, confirm that the final scaffold exhibits a good mimicry of the periodontal tissue complex, with excellent cytocompatibility and cell viability, making it very promising for regenerative applications in dentistry.},

The wave control relies on the simultaneous activation of two scattering mechanisms in the constituent elements. The approach is illustrated by numerical results for a configuration comprising phononic plates with cross-like cavities. We report complete bandgaps of tunable width due to variations of geometric parameters. We show that the wave attenuation performance of the hybrid metamaterials can be further enhanced through implementation of lightweight multiphase material compositions. These give rise to efficient wave attenuation in challenging low-frequency regions. The proposed design strategy is not limited to the analyzed cases alone and can be applied to various designs of phononic plates with cavities, inclusions or slender elements.},

abstract = {This work studies the acoustic band structure of tensegrity mass-spring chains, and the possibility to tune the dispersion relation of such systems by suitably varying local and global prestress variables. Building on established results of the Bloch–Floquet theory, the paper first investigates the linearized response of chains composed of tensegrity units and lumped masses, which undergo small oscillations around an initial equilibrium state. The stiffness of the units in such a state varies with an internal self-stress induced by prestretching the cables forming the tensegrity units, and the global prestress induced by the application of compression forces to the terminal bases. The given results show that frequency band gaps of monoatomic and biatomic chains can be effectively altered by the fine tuning of local and global prestress parameters, while keeping material properties unchanged. Numerical results on the wave dynamics of chains under moderately large displacements confirm the presence of frequency band gaps of the examined systems in the elastically hardening regime. Novel engineering uses of the examined systems are discussed.},

abstract = {The friction force observed at macroscale is the result of interactions at various lower length scales that are difficult to model in a combined manner. For this reason, simplified approaches are required, depending on the specific aspect to be investigated. In particular, the dimensionality of the system is often reduced, especially in models designed to provide a qualitative description of frictional properties of elastic materials, e.g. the spring-block model. In this paper, we implement for the first time a two dimensional extension of the spring-block model, applying it to structured surfaces and investigating by means of numerical simulations the frictional behaviour of a surface in the presence of features like cavities, pillars or complex anisotropic structures. We show how friction can be effectively tuned by appropriate design of such surface features.},

abstract = {Hierarchical structures with constituents over multiple length scales are found in various natural materials like bones, shells, spider silk and others, all of which display enhanced quasistatic mechanical properties, such as high specific strength, stiffness, and toughness. At the same time, the role of hierarchy on the dynamic behavior of metamaterials remains largely unexplored. This study numerically and experimentally assesses the effect of bioinspired hierarchical organization as well as of viscoelasticity on the wave attenuation properties of continuous elastic metamaterials. We consider single-phase metamaterials formed by self-similar unit cells with different hierarchical levels and types of hierarchy. Two types of structures are considered: a hub-spoke geometry with thin connecting elements and nested hierarchical organization, and a crosslike porous geometry with external hierarchical organization. In the first, hierarchical elements occur at similar size scales, while in the second they differ by one order of magnitude. Results highlight a number of advantages through the introduction of structural hierarchy. Band gaps relative to the corresponding nonhierarchical structures are mostly preserved in both types of structures, but additional hierarchically-induced band gaps also appear, and the hierarchical configuration allows the tuning of band-gap frequencies to lower frequencies in the crosslike porous geometry, with a simultaneous significant reduction of the global structural weight. We show that even small viscoelastic effects are essential in determining the overall attenuation behavior, including between band gaps. Finally, we verify the numerically-predicted multifrequency band gaps by experimental characterization of the transmission properties of crosslike structures. The approach we propose allows the incorporation of hierarchical organization in existing metamaterial configurations, with the corresponding improvement of wave-damping properties, thus extending application possibilities for elastic metamaterials to multiple frequency scales.},

abstract = {Pillared Graphene Frameworks are a novel class of microporous materials made by graphene sheets separated by organic spacers. One of their main features is that the pillar type and density can be chosen to tune the material properties. In this work, we present a computer simulation study of adsorption and dynamics of H2, CH4, CO2, N2 and O2 and binary mixtures thereof, in Pillared Graphene Frameworks with nitrogen-containing organic spacers. In general, we find that pillar density plays the most important role in determining gas adsorption. In the low-pressure regime (≲10 bar) the amount of gas adsorbed is an increasing function of pillar density. At higher pressure the opposite trend is observed. Diffusion coefficients were computed for representative structures taking into account the framework flexibility that is essential for assessing the dynamical properties of the adsorbed gases. Good performance for the gas separation in CH4/H2, CO2/H2 and CO2/N2 mixtures was found, with values comparable to those of metal-organic frameworks and zeolites.},

abstract = {The exploitation of bio-inspired solutions and of novel nanomaterials is gaining increasing attention in the field of impact protection. Indeed, especially for advanced applications, there is a growing pressure towards the reduction of the weight of protective structures without compromising their energy absorption capability. The complexity of the phenomena induced by high-energy contacts requires advanced and efficient computational models, which are also fundamental for achieving the optimum, overcoming the limits of experimental tests and physical prototyping in exploring the whole design space. At the same time, the modeling of bio-inspired toughening mechanisms requires additional capability of these methods to efficiently cover and merge different -and even disparate- size and time scales. In this chapter, we review computational methods for modeling the mechanical behavior of materials and structures under high-velocity (e.g., ballistic) impacts and crushing, with a particular focus on the nonlinear finite element method. Some recent developments in numerical simulation of impact are presented underlining merits, limits, and open problems in the modeling of bio-inspired and nanomaterial-based armors. In the end, two modeling examples, a bio-inspired ceramic-composite armor with ballistic protection capabilities and a modified honeycomb structure for energy absorption, are proposed.},

Here we demonstrate a simple strategy for the fabrication of an open porous 3D self-organized double-hierarchical carbon nanotube tube structure with properties advantageous to those existing so far. Even though no additional crosslinking exists between the individual nanotubes, a high reinforcement effect in compression and tensile characteristics is achieved by the formation of self-entangled carbon nanotube (CNT) networks in all three dimensions, employing the CNTs in their high tensile properties. Additionally, the tubular structure causes a self-enhancing effect in conductivity when employed in a 3D stretchable conductor, together with a high conductivity at low CNT concentrations. This strategy allows for an easy combination of different kinds of low-dimensional nanomaterials in a tube-shaped 3D structure, enabling the fabrication of multifunctional inorganic-carbon-polymer hybrid 3D materials.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most appealing materials in recent history for both research and commercial interest because of their outstanding physical, chemical, and electrical properties. This is particularly true for 3D arrangements of CNTs which enable their use in larger scale devices and structures. In this paper, the effect of temperature on the quasistatic and dynamic deformation behavior of 3D CNT structures is presented for the first time. An in situ high-temperature nanomechanical instrument was used inside an SEM at high vacuum to investigate mechanical properties of covalently interconnected CNT porous structures in a wide range of temperature. An irreversible bucking at the base of pillar samples was found as a major mode of deformation at room and elevated temperatures. It has been observed that elastic modulus and critical load to first buckle formation decrease progressively with increasing temperature from 25 °C to 750 °C. To understand fatigue resistance, pillars made from this unique structure were compressed to 100 cycles at room temperature and 750 °C. While the structure showed remarkable resistance to fatigue at room temperature, high temperature significantly lowers fatigue resistance. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compression highlights the critical role played by covalent interconnections which prevent localized bending and improve mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Adhesive attachment systems consisting of multiple tapes or strands are commonly found in nature, for example in spider web anchorages or in mussel byssal threads, and their structure has been found to be ingeniously architected in order to optimize mechanical properties: in particular, to maximize dissipated energy before full detachment. These properties emerge from the complex interplay between mechanical and geometric parameters, including tape stiffness, adhesive energy, attached and detached lengths and peeling angles, which determine the occurrence of three main mechanisms: elastic deformation, interface delamination and tape fracture. In this paper, we introduce a formalism to evaluate the mechanical performance of multiple tape attachments in different parameter ranges, where an optimal (not maximal) adhesion energy emerges. We also introduce a numerical model to simulate the multiple peeling behaviour of complex structures, illustrating its predictions in the case of the staple-pin architecture. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle experiment to illustrate the predicted behaviour. We expect the presented formalism and the numerical model to provide important tools for the design of bioinspired adhesive systems with tuneable or optimized detachment properties.},

This paper aimed to develop a mathematical model to numerically study the mechanical impact on the degradation of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds with different designed structures. In addition, the diffusion-governed autocatalysis on the scaffold degradation was also included, and the scaffold collapse time by an author-developed algorithm was determined. The results showed that an increase in mechanical stimulation led to an increase in the scaffold degradation rate. Moreover, different structures with a similar porosity shared a degradation tendency but had different collapse times, which was very sensitive to the diffusion coefficient of the scaffold. The present study could be helpful to understand the dynamic degradation process of PLA scaffolds, and guide the design of PLA material and scaffold structure. It may be also used as a tool for the evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo degradation performance of scaffolds.},

abstract = {Thin polymeric films are being explored for biomedical uses such as drug delivery, biofiltration, biosensors, and tissue regeneration. Of specific interest is the formation of mechanically flexible sheets, which can be formed with controllable thickness for sealing wounds, or as biomimetic cellular constructs. Flexible substrates with precise micro- and nanopatterns can function as supports for cell growth with conformal contact at the biointerface. To date, approaches to form free-standing, thin sheets are limited in the ability to present patterned architectures and micro/nanotextured surfaces. Other materials have a lack of degradability, precluding their application as cellular scaffolds. An approach is suggested using biocompatible and biodegradable films fabricated from silk fibroin. This work presents the fabrication and characterization of flexible, micropatterned, and biodegradable 2D fibroin sheets for cell adhesion and proliferation. A facile and scalable technique using photolithography is shown to fabricate optically transparent, strong, and flexible fibroin substrates with tunable and precise micropatterns over large areas. By controlling the surface architectures, the control of cell adhesion and spreading can be observed. Additionally, the base material is fully degradable via proteolysis. Through mechanical control and directing the adherent cells, it is possible to explore interactions of cells and the microscale geometric topography.},

Indeed, some authors have shown that the standard uncracked SN curve is obtained mostly from short crack propagation, assuming that the crack size a increases with the number of cycles N as [Formula presented]=H$\Delta$$\sigma$ha where h is close to the exponent of the Basquin's power law SN curve. We therefore propose a general equation for crack growth which for short cracks has the latter form, and for long cracks returns to the Paris' law. We show generalized SN curves, generalized Kitagawa–Takahashi diagrams, and discuss the application to some experimental data. The problem of short cracks remains however controversial, as we discuss with reference to some examples.},

These results have been rationalized via a first principles atomistic modellization of interfaces formed by ice water of increasing thickness and graphene and scaling laws from fracture mechanics, revealing a clear synergy between swelling and nanocarbon phase in the icephobic nature of the composite, dictated by a competition between elastic modulus and adsorption energy.

abstract = {Non-destructive testing and structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques using elastic guided waves are often limited by material inhomogeneity or geometrical irregularities of the tested parts. This is a severe restriction in many fields of engineering such as aerospace or aeronautics, where typically one needs to monitor composite structures with varying mechanical properties and complex geometries. This is particularly true in the case of multiscale composite materials, where anisotropy and material gradients may be present. Here, we provide an impact localization algorithm based on time reversal and laser vibrometry to cope with this type of complexity. The proposed approach is shown to be insensitive to local elastic wave velocity or geometrical features. The technique is based on the correlation of the measured impact response and a set of measured test data acquired at various grid points along the specimen surface, allowing high resolution in the determination of the impact point. We present both numerical finite element simulations and experimental measurements to support the proposed procedure, showing successful implementation on an eccentrically stiffened aluminum plate. The technique holds promise for advanced SHM, potentially in real time, of geometrically complex composite structures.},

abstract = {Regenerated silk (RS) is a natural polymer that results from the aggregation of liquid silk fibroin proteins. In this work, we observed that RS dispersed in aqueous solution undergoes a reversible solid/liquid transition by programmed heating/cooling cycles. Fourier transform infrared, atomic force microscopy imaging and Raman measurements of the RS reveal that the transition from random coil to $\beta$-sheet structures is involved in this liquid–solid transition. The reversible solid-liquid transition of silk fibroin was then found to be helpful to prepare polymer-like carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersions. We demonstrate that the gelation of RS makes the CNTs with the consistency of a dough with polymeric behavior. Such RS can disperse carbon nanotubes at high concentrations of tens of weight percent. Finally, such carbon nanotube dough has been used for the realization of rubber composites. With this method, we pave the way for handling nanopowders (e.g. CNTs or graphene related materials) with safety and reducing the filler volatility that is critical in polymer-processing.},

A key feature that contributes significantly to the robustness and capability to absorb high kinetic energy of spider webs is the presence of junctions connecting different silk threads. Surprisingly, in spite of their fundamental function, the mechanics of spider web junctions have never been reported. Herein, through mechanical characterization and imaging, we show for the first time that spider orb webs host two different types of junction, produced by different silk glands, which have different morphology, and load bearing capability. These differences can be explained in view of the different roles they play in the web, i.e. allowing for a localized damage control or anchoring the whole structure to the surrounding environment.},

abstract = {Tensegrity structures are special architectures made by floating compressed struts kept together by a continuous system of tensioned cables. Their existence in a mechanically stable form is decided by the possibility of finding geometrical configurations such that pre-stressed tendons and bars can ensure self-equilibrium of the forces transmitted through the elastic network, the overall stiffness of which finally depends on both the rigidity of the compressed elements and the cables' pre-stress. The multiplicity of shapes that tensegrity structures can assume and their intrinsic capability to be deployable and assembled, so storing (and releasing) elastic energy, have motivated their success as paradigm –pioneeringly proposed three decades ago by the intuition of Donald E. Ingber– to explain some underlying mechanisms regulating dynamics of living cells. The interlaced structure of the cell cytoskeleton, constituted by actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules which continuously change their spatial organization and pre-stresses through polymerization/depolymerization processes, seems in fact to steer migration, adhesion and cell division by obeying the tensegrity construct. Even though rough calculations lead to estimate discrepancies of less than one order of magnitude when comparing axial stiffness of actin filaments (cables) and microtubules (struts) and recent works have shown bent microtubules among stretched filaments, no one has yet tried to remove the standard hypothesis of rigid struts in tensegrity structures when used to idealize the cell cytoskeleton mechanical response. With reference to the 30-element tensegrity cell paradigm, we thus introduce both compressibility and bendability of the struts and accordingly rewrite the theory to simultaneously take into account geometrical non-linearity (i.e. large deformations) and hyper-elasticity of both tendons and bars, so abandoning the classical linear stress-strain constitutive assumptions. By relaxing the hypothesis of rigidity of the struts, we demonstrate that some quantitative confirmations and many related extreme and somehow counter-intuitive mechanical behaviors actually exploited by cells for storing/releasing energy, resisting to applied loads and deforming by modulating their overall elasticity and shape through pre-stress changes and instability-guided configurational switching, can be all theoretically found. It is felt that the proposed new soft-strut tensegrity model could pave the way for a wider use of engineering models in cell mechanobiology and in designing bio-inspired materials and soft robots.},

abstract = {The present work describes a novel nanocrystalline, multidoped hydroxyapatite featuring excellent eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cell selectivity, attested by excellent osteoinductive character and evaluated with human stem cells, and anti-infective ability, tested against different pathogens. Physicochemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/scanning STEM observations highlighted that such enhanced biological features are related to the lower crystallinity level and increased surface charge of hydroxyapatite, both induced by multiple-ion doping. Specifically, the lattice substitution of Ca2+ with Zn2+ promotes the segregation of Ca2+ and doping Mg2+ cations to a less-ordered surface layer, thus promoting dynamic ion absorption/release acting as bioactive signals for cells and exerting an antiproliferative effect on all tested pathogens. These findings open the design of new biodevices, combining regenerative ability and effective microbial inhibition without using any antibiotic drugs. This is extremely important to circumvent bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which is today considered as one of the biggest threats to global health.},

abstract = {Bionic materials are often formed in the nanometer scale through diverse metabolic activities of cell walls and those of insects or worms by natural incorporation of biominerals in their structures. Exploitation of processes used by microorganisms to digest nutrients for their growth can be a viable method for the formation of a wide range of so-called biogenic materials. These have unique structure and mechanical properties that we cannot find in their abiotic counterparts. This book chapter will explore such living factories and will address first attempts in producing bionic superfibers, focusing on their synthesis, structure, and properties, such as those obtained by the authors by feeding spiders or yeast microorganisms with nanomaterials. This chapter will also focus on the development of novel porous bionicomposites by means of biogenesis without the postsynthesis addition of the inorganic components that have unusual mechanical and physical properties. In this context, the reported case studies could have future implications on bionic materials in the manufacture of more complex smart objects with multifunctional properties.},

abstract = {New possibilities have emerged in recent years, with the development of high-precision fabrication techniques, to exploit microscale surface patterning to modify tribological properties of polymeric materials. However, the effect of surface topography, together with material mechanical parameters, needs to be fully understood to allow the design of surfaces with the desired characteristics. In this paper, we experimentally assess the effect of various types of micropatterned Polydimethylsiloxane surfaces, including anisotropic ones, on macroscopic substrate friction properties. We find that it is possible, through surface patterning, to modify both static and dynamic friction coefficients of the surfaces, demonstrating the possibility of achieving tunability. Additionally, we compare experimental observations with the numerical predictions of a 2D Spring-Block model, deriving the material parameters from tests on the corresponding flat surfaces. We find a good quantitative agreement between calculated and measured trends for various micropattern geometries, demonstrating that the proposed numerical approach can reliably describe patterned surfaces when appropriate material parameters are used. The presented results can further contribute to the description and understanding of the frictional effects of surface patterning, with the aim of achieving surfaces with extreme tunability of tribological properties.},

abstract = {Bulk samples of kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) were produced by cold-pressing and sintering of CZTS powders obtained via reactive ball-milling. An increase in the Seebeck coefficient of more than 100 $\mu$V/K, almost doubling the expected value, is noticed around a temperature of 260 °C. As pointed out by thermal analyses, this is due to a second order transition of kesterite from an ordered I-4 to a disordered I-42m crystal structure. Conversely to what happens for solar cell materials, where the transition is considered to be detrimental for the performance, it appears to be beneficial for the thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient, suggesting that higher crystal symmetry and cation-disorder due to the transition lead to thermopower enhancement.},

abstract = {Silicon is a promising material for tissue engineering since it allows to produce micropatterned scaffolding structures resembling biological tissues. Using specific fabrication methods, it is possible to build aligned 3D network-like structures. In the present study, we exploited vertically-aligned silicon micropillar arrays as culture systems for human iPSC-derived cortical progenitors. In particular, our aim was to mimic the radially-oriented cortical radial glia fibres that during embryonic development play key roles in controlling the expansion, radial migration and differentiation of cortical progenitors, which are, in turn, pivotal to the establishment of the correct multilayered cerebral cortex structure. Here we show that silicon vertical micropillar arrays efficiently promote expansion and stemness preservation of human cortical progenitors when compared to standard monolayer growth conditions. Furthermore, the vertically-oriented micropillars allow the radial migration distinctive of cortical progenitors in vivo. These results indicate that vertical silicon micropillar arrays can offer an optimal system for human cortical progenitors' growth and migration. Furthermore, similar structures present an attractive platform for cortical tissue engineering.},

abstract = {Aquatic predatory insects, like the nymphs of a dragonfly, use rapid movements to catch their prey. Dragonfly nymphs are voracious predators that feed on smaller aquatic organisms. In this study, we examine dragonfly nymph (Libellulidae: Insecta: Odonata) mouthparts that are used in prey capturing and feeding. In particular, we characterise the morphology of the labium and mechanical properties of the mandibles of the nymph. Additionally, we record and analyse the preying mechanism using high-speed photography. The morphological details suggest that the prey capturing mechanism is a complex grasping mechanism with additional sensory organs that might aid in sensing the surroundings. The times taken for the extension and retraction of labial organ during prey capture was 187±54 ms. The Young's modulus and hardness of the mandibles samples were 9.1±1.9 GPa and 0.85±0.13 GPa. Gradation in the mechanical properties was also observed in the mandible tip regions with increased properties at the tip end. The overall mechanism with its sensory capabilities provides a unique design to develop bioinspired underwater deployable mechanisms.},

abstract = {Acoustic filters and metamaterials have become essential components for elastic wave control in applications ranging from ultrasonics to noise abatement. Other devices have been designed in this field, emulating their electromagnetic counterparts. One such case is an acoustic diode or rectifier, which enables one-way wave transmission by breaking the wave equation-related reciprocity. Its achievement, however, has proved to be rather problematic, and current realizations display a number of shortcomings in terms of simplicity and versatility. Here, we present the design, fabrication and characterization of a device able to work as an acoustic diode, a switch and a transistor-like apparatus, exploiting symmetry-breaking nonlinear effects like harmonic generation and wave mixing, and the filtering capabilities of metamaterials. This device presents several advantages compared with previous acoustic diode realizations, including versatility, time invariance, frequency preserving characteristics and switchability. We numerically evaluate its efficiency and demonstrate its feasibility in a preliminary experimental realization. This work may provide new opportunities for the practical realization of structural components with one-way wave propagation properties.},

abstract = {Wet spinning of polyacrylonitrile/carbon nanotubes (PAN/CNT) composite fibers was studied and the effect of spinning conditions on structure and properties of as-spun fibers influenced by the presence of CNTs investigated. Unlike PAN fibers, shear force had a larger effect on crystalline structure and physical and mechanical properties of PAN/CNT composite fibers compared to the elongational force inside a coagulation bath. Under shear force CNTs induced nucleation of new crystals, whereas under elongational force nucleation of new crystals were hindered but the already formed crystals grew bigger. To our knowledge, this key effect has not been reported elsewhere. At different shear rates, strength, Young's modulus and strain at break of PAN/CNT as-spun fibers were improved up to 20% compared to PAN fibers. Application of jet stretch had less influence on physical and mechanical properties of PAN/CNT fibers compared to PAN fibers. However, the improvement of interphase between polymer chains and CNTs as a result of chain orientation may have contributed to enhancement of Young's modulus of jet stretched composite fibers.},

abstract = {Graphyne nanotubes (GNTs) are nanostructures obtained from rolled up graphyne sheets, in the same way carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are obtained from graphene ones. Graphynes are 2D carbon-allotropes composed of atoms in sp and sp2 hybridized states. Similarly to conventional CNTs, GNTs can present different chiralities and electronic properties. Because of the acetylenic groups (triple bonds), GNTs exhibit large sidewall pores that influence their mechanical properties. In this work, we studied the mechanical response of GNTs under tensile stress using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that GNTs mechanical failure (fracture) occurs at larger strain values in comparison to corresponding CNTs, but paradoxically with smaller ultimate strength and Young's modulus values. This is a consequence of the combined effects of the existence of triple bonds and increased porosity/flexibility due to the presence of acetylenic groups.},

abstract = {Vertebrate teeth are complex structures adapted in terms of shape and structure to serve a variety of functions like biting and grinding. Thus, examining the morphology, composition and mechanical properties of the teeth can aid in providing insights into the feeding behaviour of extinct species. We here provide the first mechanical characterisation of teeth in a spinosaurid dinosaur, Suchomimus tenerensis, and a pholidosaurid crocodylomorph, Sarcosuchus imperator. Our results show that both species have similar macrostructure of enamel, dental and interfacial layers, and similar composition, the main constituent being fluorapatite. Microindentation tests show that Suchomimus teeth have lower elastic modulus and hardness, as compared to Sarchosuchus. On the contrary, Sarcosuchus teeth have lower toughness. Nanoindentation showed the existence of mechanical gradients from dentin to enamel in Suchomimus and, less prominently, in Sarcosuchus. This was also supported by wear tests showing that in Suchomimus the dentin region is more wear-prone than the enamel region. With still scarce information available on the dietary regimes in extinct species, the analysis of micro and nano-mechanical properties of fossils teeth might be a help in targeting specific biological questions. However, much is still unknown concerning the changes underwent by organic material during diagenesis making at present impossible to definitely conclude if the differences in the mechanical properties of Suchomimus and Sarchosuchus here retrieved imply that the two species adopted different strategies when dealing with food processing or are the result of disparate taphonomic histories.},

abstract = {MEMS-based tensile testing platforms are very powerful tools for the mechanical characterization of nanoscale materials, as they allow for testing of micro/nano-sized components in situ electron microscopes. In a typical configuration, they consist of an actuator, to deliver force/displacement, and a load sensor, which is connected to the sample like springs in series. Such configuration, while providing a high resolution force measurement, can cause the onset of instability phenomena, which can later compromise the test validity. In the present paper such phenomena are quantitatively discussed through the development of an analytical model, which allows to find a relationship between the rise of instability and the sensor stiffness, which is the key parameter to be optimized.},

abstract = {Wood boring is a feature of several insect species and is a major cause of severe and irreparable damage to trees. Adult females typically deposit their eggs on the stem surface under bark scales. The emerging hatchlings live within hard wood during their larval phase, avoiding possible predation, whilst continually boring and tunneling through wood until pupation. A study of wood boring by insects offers unique insights into the bioengineering principles that drive evolutionary adaptations. We show that larval mandibles of the coffee wood stem borer beetle (Xylotrechus quadripes: Cerambycidae) have a highly sharp cusp edge to initiate fractures in Arabica wood and a suitable shape to generate small wood chips that are suitable for digestion. Cuticle hardness at the tip is significantly enhanced through zinc-enrichment. Finite element model of the mandible, based on the differential material properties at the tip, intermediate and base regions of the mandible, showed highest stresses in the tip region; these decreased to significantly lower values at the start of the hollow section. A hollow architecture significantly reduces bending stresses at mandibular base without compromising the structural integrity. A scaling model based on a fracture mechanics framework shows the importance of the mandible shape in generating optimal chip sizes. These findings contain general principles in tool design and put in focus interactions of insects and their woody hosts.},

abstract = {Understanding nanoscale molecular order within organic electronic materials is a crucial factor in building better organic electronic devices. At present, techniques capable of imaging molecular order within a polymer are limited in resolution, accuracy, and accessibility. In this work, presented are secondary electron (SE) spectroscopy and secondary electron hyperspectral imaging, which make an exciting alternative approach to probing molecular ordering in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with scanning electron microscope-enabled resolution. It is demonstrated that the crystalline content of a P3HT film is reflected by its SE energy spectrum, both empirically and through correlation with nano-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, an innovative technique for exploring nanoscale chemistry. The origin of SE spectral features is investigated using both experimental and modeling approaches, and it is found that the different electronic properties of amorphous and crystalline P3HT result in SE emission with different energy distributions. This effect is exploited by acquiring hyperspectral SE images of different P3HT films to explore localized molecular orientation. Machine learning techniques are used to accurately identify and map the crystalline content of the film, demonstrating the power of an exciting characterization technique.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a computational method, based on the Monte Carlo statistical approach, for calculating electron energy emission and yield spectra of metals, such as copper, silver and gold. The calculation of these observables proceeds via the Mott theory with a Dirac-Hartree-Fock spherical potential to deal with the elastic scattering processes, and by using the Ritchie dielectric approach to model the electron inelastic scattering events. In the latter case, the dielectric function, which represents the starting point for the evaluation of the energy loss, is obtained from experimental reflection electron energy loss spectra. The generation of secondary electrons upon ionization of the samples is also implemented in the calculation. A remarkable agreement is obtained between both theoretical and experimental electron emission spectra and yield curves.},

abstract = {As being only one atom thick, most of the device applications require graphene to be partially or fully supported by a substrate, which is typically silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). According to a common understanding, graphene interacts with SiO 2 through weak, long-range van der Waals forces, emerging between instantaneous/induced dipoles, in contrast to the experimental evidence that reveals a surprisingly high interaction between graphene and SiO 2 . In order to get further insight into this phenomenon, we carried out diverse physical measurements on SiO 2 substrates, prepared via different fabrication protocols, with and without graphene on top. As a result, the role of the oxide surface charges is recognized for the first time as a main factor causing graphene to strongly interact with SiO 2 . Our findings provide guidelines for designing 2D materials interaction with a substrate through modulation of surface charges. This, in turn, can facilitate the development of new graphene based microelectronic devices.},

abstract = {In the last years, due to their exceptional mechanical properties (elastic modulus of about 1 TPa and tensile strength of 130-150 GPa), single and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs and MWCNTs) have encountered an increasing interest among scientists. More recently, a number of studies have also envisaged the possibility of building up a new generation of composites with elastomeric or polymeric matrix, reinforced with MWCNTs, to gain high mechanical performances and other physical properties. However, independently from problems related to accuracy and costs associated to the processing and the production of MWCNTS and some difficulties in exactly controlling their dimensions, distribution and geometry, a detailed micromechanical description of the overall elastic response of these complex structures-that appear to be constituted by several layers organized as hollow cylindrical phases wrapped around a central core-is still at the center of a vivid debate, because it is expected that their chirality induces an anisotropic (e.g. trigonal/monoclinic) elastic behavior, which is characterized by a coupling between torsion and axial deformations. This is a relevant aspect for the developing of stresses inside the reinforcements and, importantly, for predicting the actual stress regimes at the interfaces and in turn the overall mechanical behavior of these composites, with transferring of spurious shear stresses and size effects. In this framework, due to the difficulties of deriving analytical results for the mechanical response of these multi-wall elastically monoclinic cylinders, the vast majority of the literature efforts have presented numerical results, for example by performing Finite Element (FE) analyses or by estimating the stiffness of these structures, at different scale levels, through molecular dynamics (MD) strategies. The present contribution is therefore aimed to furnish new closed-form elastic solutions for general compound cylinders, made by n hallow monoclinic/trigonal phases and a possible central core, under prescribed boundary conditions of interest for applications, to be implemented in computational FE algorithms for faithfully replicating the actual mechanical response of composites reinforced with MWCNTs.},

abstract = {Objectives: Winter sports are high-energy outdoor activities involving high velocities and acrobatic maneuvers, thus raising safety concerns. Specific studies on the impact mechanics of back protectors are very limited. In this study analytical and numerical models are developed to rationalize results of impact experiments and propose new design procedures for this kind of equipment. Design: Different soft-shell solutions currently available on the market are compared. In particular, the role of dynamic material constitutive properties and of environmental temperature (which affects mainly material stiffness) on energy absorption capability are evaluated. Methods: Starting from dynamic mechanical–thermal characterization of the closed-cell polymeric foams constituting the protectors, we exploited analytical modeling and Finite Element Method simulations to interpret experimental data from drop weight impact test and to characterize protectors at different temperatures and after multiple impacts. Results: The temperature and frequency dependent properties of these materials characterize their impact behavior. Modeling results are in good agreement with impact tests. Results demonstrate how ergonomic soft-shell solution provides an advantage with respect to traditional hard-shell in terms of impact protection. Moreover, it can maintain nearly unaltered its protective properties after multiple impacts on the same point. Conclusions: The coupled analytical-simulation approach here presented could be extensively used to predict the impact behavior of such equipment, starting from material characterization, allowing to save costs and time for physical prototyping and tests for design and optimization.},

abstract = {The cuticle of stomatopod is an example of a natural mineralized biomaterial, consisting of chitin, amorphous calcium carbonate and protein components with a multiscale hierarchical structure, and forms a protective shell with high impact resistance. At the ultrastructural level, cuticle mechanical functionality is enabled by the nanoscale architecture, wherein chitin fibrils are in intimate association with enveloping mineral and proteins. However, the interactions between these ultrastructural building blocks, and their coupled response to applied load, remain unclear. Here, we elucidate these interactions via synchrotron microbeam wide-angle X-ray diffraction combined with in situ tensile loading, to quantify the chitin crystallite structure of native cuticle – and after demineralization and deproteinization – as well as time-resolved changes in chitin fibril strain on macroscopic loading. We demonstrate chitin crystallite stabilization by mineral, seen via a compressive pre-strain of approximately 0.10% (chitin/protein fibre pre-stress of ∼20 MPa), which is lost on demineralization. Clear reductions of stiffness at the fibrillar-level following matrix digestion are linked to the change in the protein/matrix mechanical properties. Furthermore, both demineralization and deproteinization alter the 3D-pattern of deformation of the fibrillar network, with a non-symmetrical angular fibril strain induced by the chemical modifications, associated with loss of the load-transferring interfibrillar matrix. Our results demonstrate and quantify the critical role of interactions at the nanoscale (between chitin-protein and chitin-mineral) in enabling the molecular conformation and outstanding mechanical properties of cuticle, which will inform future design of hierarchical bioinspired composites. Statement of Significance: Chitinous biomaterials (e.g. arthropod cuticle) are widespread in nature and attracting attention for bioinspired design due to high impact resistance coupled with light weight. However, how the nanoscale interactions of the molecular building blocks – alpha-chitin, protein and calcium carbonate mineral – lead to these material properties is not clear. Here we used X-ray scattering to determine the cooperative interactions between chitin fibrils, protein matrix and biominerals, during tissue loading. We find that the chitin crystallite structure is stabilized by mineral nanoparticles, the protein phase prestresses chitin fibrils, and that chemical modification of the interfibrillar matrix significantly disrupts 2D mechanics of the microfibrillar chitin plywood network. These results will aid rational design of advanced chitin-based biomaterials with high impact resistance.},

abstract = {Combining a series of atomistic simulations with fracture mechanics theory, we systematically investigate the crack growth stability of graphene under tension and indentation, with a pre-existing crack made by two methods: atom removal and (artificial) bonding removal. In the tension, the monotonically increasing energy release rate G is consistent with the unstable crack growth. In contrast, the non-monotonic G with a maximum for indentation explains the transition from unstable to stable crack growth when the crack length is comparable to the diameter of the contact zone. We also find that the crack growth stability within a stable crack growth regime can be significantly affected by the crack tip sharpness even down to a single atom scale. A crack made by atom removal starts to grow at a higher indentation force than the ultimately sharp crack made by bonding removal, which leads to a large force drop at the onset of the crack growth that can cause unstable crack growth under indentation with force control. In addition, we investigate the effect of the offset distance between the indenter and the crack to the indentation fracture force and find that the graphene with a smaller initial crack is more sensitive. The findings reported in this study can be applied to other related 2D materials because crack growth stability is determined primarily by the geometrical factors of the mechanical loading.},

abstract = {O-ring type elastomer seals are common in different industries. Friction plays a critical role on the setting and actual performance of the components. Design for gland dimensions, compression levels, extrusion gap size and pressure ratings are well known in the industry. The viscoelastic effects however, are not commonly accounted for. Simulation packages use fixed friction coefficients, or pressure dependent ones. If this is the case, then dependence of frictional behaviour is purely obtained from the instantaneous stress response. Temperature changes are then only related to changes in elastic modulus, ignoring viscoelastic behaviour altogether. Also, polished surfaces still have a significant roughness contribution to friction at higher setting speeds (>10mm/s). An experimental O-ring friction testing is used to observe the effects temperature, surface roughness, speed and pressure on rubber friction. FEA is used to obtain the normal force to help calculate changes in the coefficient of friction.},

abstract = {The hyperelastic behaviour of an elastomer is typically modelled using strain-energy functions (SEFs) that describe the stress-strain response. SEFs have received attention for unfilled and filled rubbers. Studies on the latter often consider tyres or vibration dampers. The present work is motivated by highly filled oilfield sealing materials. Such compounds exhibit a rapid reduction in low strain modulus and most hyperelastic models cannot fully capture this effect. The problem is illustrated by fitting existing SEFs to stress-strain data for oilfield rubbers. A modified first invariant based Amin-Alam-Okui SEF (2002) which is a generalisation of the Yeoh SEF (1990) is proposed to model this rapid reduction in modulus without compromising the ability to simulate finite-extensibility. This SEF captures low strain inflections in uniaxial compression, a phenomenon that has been observed in previous publications. Stability considerations are discussed and the SEF is implemented in Abaqus for a 3-D general strain problem.},

abstract = {We present a smart robot structure that exploits anisotropic friction to achieve stick-slip locomotion. The robot is made out of three components: a plastic beam, a planar dielectric elastomer actuator and four bristle pads with asymmetric rigid metallic bristles. We show that when the robot is electronically activated at increasing frequency, its structure exploits the resonance condition to reach the maximum locomotion speed. The fundamental frequency of the structure is estimated both analytically and numerically, allowing the range of frequencies in which the top locomotion speed was observed during the experiments to be identified. The locomotion speed of the robot as a function of the actuation frequency is estimated with a frequency response analysis performed on a discretised model of the structure, revealing good agreement with the experimental evidence.},

So far, no inorganic artificial micro/nanostructure units are known that self-organize and mimic such functions just by adding liquid. Here we develop the first nanomaterial exhibiting hydrophobic wetting and hydrophilic dewetting. Consisting of gallium nitride nanoscopically thin membranes shaped as hollow microtetrapods, which we term aerogalnite (AGaN), the nanomaterial is extremely porous, mechanically flexible, stretchable, and exhibits hydrophilicity under tension and hydrophobicity when compressed against water. Self-assembling the AGaN tetrapods on water enabled us to develop self-healing waterproof rafts carrying liquid droplets 500-times as heavy as rafts, and to demonstrate self-propelled liquid marbles exhibiting velocity of rotation as high as 750 rot/min. The specific force of the detachment of AGaN from the water surface was experimentally determined equal to 35 mN/cm2. The new developed material aerogalnite and its peculiar characteristics are promising for applications in sensorics, microfluidic devices and microrobotics.},

abstract = {Strain energy functions (SEFs) are used to model the hyperelastic behavior of rubberlike materials. In tension, the stress-strain response of these materials often exhibits three characteristics: (i) a decreasing modulus at low strains (<20%), (ii) a constant modulus at intermediate strains, and (iii) an increasing modulus at high strains (>200%). Fitting an SEF that works in each regime is challenging when multiple or nonhomogeneous deformation modes are considered. The difficulty increases with highly filled elastomers because the small strain nonlinearity increases and finite-extensibility occurs at lower strains. One can compromise by fitting an SEF to a limited range of strain, but this is not always appropriate. For example, rubber seals in oilfield packers can exhibit low global strains but high localized strains. The Davies-De-Thomas (DDT) SEF is a good candidate for modeling such materials. Additional improvements will be shown by combining concepts from the DDT and Yeoh SEFs to construct a more versatile SEF. The SEF is implemented with user-defined material subroutines in Abaqus/Standard (UHYPER) and Abaqus/Explicit (VUMAT) for a three-dimensional general strain problem, and an approach to overcome a mathematically indeterminate stress condition in the unstrained state is derived. The complete UHYPER and VUMAT subroutines are also presented.},

abstract = {Beetles are by far one of the most successful groups of insects, with large diversity in terms of number of species. A part of this success is attributed to their elytra, which provide various functions such as protection to their bodies from mechanical forces. In this study, stag beetle (Lucanus cervus) elytra were first examined for their overall flexural properties and were observed to have a localized shape-retaining snap-through mechanism, which may play a possible role in partly absorbing impact energy, e.g., during battles and falls from heights. The snap-through mechanism was validated using theoretical calculations and also finite element simulations. Elytra were also characterized to examine their puncture and wear resistance. Our results show that elytra have a puncture resistance that is much higher than that of mandible bites. The measured values of modulus and hardness of elytra exocuticle were 10.3 ± 0.8 GPa and 0.7 ± 0.1 GPa, respectively. Using the hardness-to-modulus ratio as an indicator of wear resistance, the estimated value was observed to be in the range of wear-resistant biological material such as blood worms (Glyrcera dibranchiata). Thus, our study demonstrates different mechanical properties of the stag beetle elytra, which can be explored to design shape-retaining bio-inspired composites with enhanced puncture and wear resistance.},

abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on the hypervelocity dynamics of shock compressed graphite -up to hundreds of gigapascals- and impacted multilayer graphene armours by employing the AIREBO-M potential. The Morse-type non-singular intermolecular interaction allows the usage of relatively large integration timesteps for simulating materials' response at such high strain-rate. The MD simulation results are in good agreement with the shock Hugoniot curves and with graphite-to-diamond transition obtained from both density functional theory (DFT) and experiments available in literature. We then show that thermodynamic properties of graphite from MD calculations can be used as input for a reliable equation of state to be employed in continuum simulations. Finally, we find that the size-scaling of the hypervelocity impact properties of graphene armours matches well with the DFT results and theoretical predictions of earlier studies. Our results open a concrete possibility towards accurate and fast multiscale simulation from atomistic to continuum level of shock propagation, shock-induced phase transformation, and dynamic fracture in large or hierarchical carbon systems, such as graphene-based foams and nanocomposites.},

In our model, fluid forces trigger a fracture of the inter-layer interface by lifting a flexible “flap” of nanomaterial from the surface of a suspended microparticle. We show that the so far ignored dependence of the hydrodynamic load on the wedge angle produces a transition in the curve relating the critical fluid shear rate for peeling to the non-dimensional adhesion energy. For intermediate values of the non-dimensional adhesion energy, the critical shear rate saturates, yielding critical shear rate values that are drastically smaller than those predicted by a constant load assumption.

abstract = {The adhesive behavior of biological attachment structures such as spider web anchorages is usually studied using single or multiple peeling models involving “tapes”, i.e. one-dimensional contacts elements. This is an oversimplification for many practical problems, since the actual delamination process requires the modeling of complex two-dimensional adhesive elements. To achieve this, we develop a theoretical-numerical approach to simulate the detachment of an elastic membrane of finite size from a substrate, using a 3D cohesive law. The model is validated using existing analytical results for simple geometries, and then applied in a series of parametric studies. Results show how the pull-off force can be tuned or optimized by varying different geometrical or mechanical parameters in various loading scenarios. The length of the detachment boundary, known as the peeling line, emerges as the key factor to maximize adhesion. The approach presented here can allow a better understanding of the mechanical behavior of biological adhesives with complex geometries or with material anisotropies, highlighting the interaction between the stress distributions at the interface and in the membrane itself.},

These defects are well known to have detrimental effects on properties such as thermal and electrical conductivities as well as mechanical properties. With a two-fold objective of synthesizing graphite films with large single crystal grains and no wrinkles, we have developed a relatively low-temperature (<1150 °C) process that involves the precipitation of graphite films from nickel–carbon solid solutions followed by in-situ etching of the nickel foil substrates with anhydrous chlorine gas to obtain near wrinkle-free continuous graphite films. The size (La) distribution of lateral grains (or single crystal regions) in these highly oriented graphite films has been found to be asymmetric with the largest grains about 0.9 mm in diameter, as determined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Thus, the growth of large-area graphite films with grains much larger than those reported for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, ∼20 to 30 $\mu$m), and with a low density of wrinkles, as in the case of HOPG, but prepared at much lower temperatures, is reported here.},

Thus, investigation and modelling of puncturing mechanics of snakes is of importance to understand the form-function relationship of the fangs and tissue-fang interactions in detail. We have thus chosen fangs of two snake species, i.e., viper (Bitis arietans) and burrowing snake (Atractaspis aterrima), with different shape and size, and performed insertion experiments using tissue phantoms. Our results showed that the fangs of both species have similar mechanical properties but there was a difference in the insertion forces owing to the difference in shape of the fang. Also, we developed an analytical model of the fang-tissue interaction and obtained a good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, our study can help in the development of bioinspired needles that can potentially have reduced insertion forces and optimised tissue penetration.},

In this paper, we exploit the recent discovery of the presence of hairs in the acetabulum roof of octopus suction cups to revise the current model for its adhesion to the acetabulum wall. We show how this additional feature, which can be considered an example of a hierarchical structure, can lead to an increase of adhesive strength, based on the analysis of the cases of a simple tape and an axisymmetrical membrane adhering to a substrate. Using peeling theory, we discuss in both cases the influence of hierarchical structure and the resulting variation of geometry on the adhesive energy, highlighting how an increase in number of hierarchical levels contributes to its increment, with a corresponding improvement in functionality for the octopus suckers.},

abstract = {Self-regeneration is a fundamental property of biological materials, leading to enhanced mechanical strength and toughness if subjected to stress and fatigue. Numerous efforts have been devoted to emulate this property and various self-healing materials have been designed with the aim of a practical adoption in construction and mechanical engineering. To achieve this, it is important to understand how damage evolution and fracture propagation are modified by self-healing and to evaluate how mechanical behaviour is affected before failure. In this paper, we implement for the first time a self-healing procedure in the random fuse model, whose characteristic scaling properties have been widely studied in the literature on damage evolution modelling. We identify some characteristic signatures of self-healing, showing that it can delay the failure of a material undergoing loading, but it also lead to a hard-to-predict, more catastrophic breakdown.},

abstract = {In this paper, the impact behaviour of composite laminates is investigated, and their potential for ballistic protection assessed, as a function of the reinforcing materials and structures for three representative fibre-reinforced epoxy systems involving carbon, glass, or para-aramid fibre reinforcements, respectively. A multiscale coupled experimental/numerical study on the composite material properties is performed, starting from single fibre, to fibre bundles (yarns), to single composite ply, and finally at laminate level. Uniaxial tensile tests on single fibres and fibre bundles are performed, and the results are used as input for non-linear Finite Element Method (FEM) models for tensile and impact simulation on the composite laminates. Mechanical properties and energy dissipation of the single ply and multilayer laminates under quasi-static loading are preliminarily assessed starting from the mechanical properties of the constituents and subsequently verified numerically. FEM simulations of ballistic impact on multilayer armours are then performed, assessing the three different composites, showing good agreement with experimental tests in terms of impact energy absorption capabilities and deformation/failure behaviour. As result, a generalized multiscale version of the well-known Cuniff criterion is provided as a scaling law, which allows to assess the ballistic performance of laminated composites, starting from the tensile mechanical properties of the fibres and fibre bundles and their volume fraction. The presented multiscale coupled experimental-numerical characterization confirms the reliability of the predictions for full-scale laminate properties starting from the individual constituents at the single fibre scale.},

abstract = {Supramolecular chemistry offers an exciting opportunity to assemble materials with molecular precision. However, there remains an unmet need to turn molecular self-assembly into functional materials and devices. Harnessing the inherent properties of both disordered proteins and graphene oxide (GO), we report a disordered protein-GO co-assembling system that through a diffusion-reaction process and disorder-to-order transitions generates hierarchically organized materials that exhibit high stability and access to non-equilibrium on demand. We use experimental approaches and molecular dynamics simulations to describe the underlying molecular mechanism of formation and establish key rules for its design and regulation. Through rapid prototyping techniques, we demonstrate the system's capacity to be controlled with spatio-temporal precision into well-defined capillary-like fluidic microstructures with a high level of biocompatibility and, importantly, the capacity to withstand flow. Our study presents an innovative approach to transform rational supramolecular design into functional engineering with potential widespread use in microfluidic systems and organ-on-a-chip platforms.},

abstract = {Hybrid nanomaterials fabricated by the heterogeneous integration of 1D (carbon nanotubes) and 2D (graphene oxide) nanomaterials showed synergy in electrical and mechanical properties. Here, we reported the infiltration of carboxylic functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (C-SWNT) into free-standing graphene oxide (GO) paper for better electrical and mechanical properties than native GO. The stacking arrangement of GO sheets and its alteration in the presence of C-SWNT were comprehensively explored through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction. The C-SWNTs bridges between different GO sheets produce a pathway for the flow of electrical charges and provide a tougher hybrid system. The nanoscopic surface potential map reveals a higher work function of the individual functionalised SWNTs than surrounded GO sheets showing efficient charge exchange. We observed the enhanced conductivity up to 50 times and capacitance up to 3.5 times of the hybrid structure than the GO-paper. The laminate of polystyrene composites provided higher elastic modulus and mechanical strength when hybrid paper is used, thus paving the way for the exploitation of hybrid filler formulation in designing polymer composites.},

However, state-of-the-art laser diode-based lighting systems rely on light-converting inorganic phosphor materials, which strongly limit the efficiency and lifetime, as well as achievable light output due to energy losses, saturation, thermal degradation, and low irradiance levels. Here, we demonstrate a macroscopically expanded, three-dimensional diffuser composed of interconnected hollow hexagonal boron nitride microtubes with nanoscopic wall-thickness, acting as an artificial solid fog, capable of withstanding $\sim$10 times the irradiance level of remote phosphors. In contrast to phosphors, no light conversion is required as the diffuser relies solely on strong broadband (full visible range) lossless multiple light scattering events, enabled by a highly porous (>99.99%) non-absorbing nanoarchitecture, resulting in efficiencies of $\sim$98%. This can unleash the potential of lasers for high-brightness lighting applications, such as automotive headlights, projection technology or lighting for large spaces.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of polymer-derived ceramics are usually measured on samples pyrolyzed in inert atmosphere. Here, we report the hardness and elastic modulus of SiOC and SiCN pyrolyzed in both inert (Ar) and reactive (CO2) atmosphere. The external surface of the specimens exposed to the pyrolysis gas was characterized by Vickers microhardness measurements and infrared spectroscopy. The elastic modulus was evaluated by three-point bending tests on thin (150-200 µm) and dense specimens. Polished sections of the SiOC samples were prepared to study, by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and nanoindentation, how the elemental composition, hardness, and elastic modulus vary from the surface toward the bulk. For both compositions, pyrolysis in CO2 leads to a strong decrease in the hardness and elastic modulus. The hardness of both the samples pyrolyzed in CO2 approaches the typical value for fused silica, suggesting that CO2 selectively breaks the Si–C and Si–N bonds and leads to the formation of a silica-like network. EDXS and nanoindentation reveal that the modification induced by the CO2 flow extends below the surface at least for a thickness of about 30 µm.},

Roots have developed different adaptive responses, such as increase or decrease of the elongation rate of the apical region and swelling or shrinking of its diameter. We propose a mathematical model aimed at explaining the dynamic evolution of plant roots during the penetration into the soil. We treat the root as a cylinder and the root–soil interaction as a purely mechanical inclusion problem. In particular, the root dynamic evolution is based on a modified version by one of the authors of the extended universal law of West, Brown, and Enquist. Coupling the solution of the mechanical problem and the growth equation, we compare the theoretical results with experimental data collected in artificial and real soils. In this work, we propose a plausible interpretation of the experimental results of the root behavior during the growth inside the surrounding soil medium.},

abstract = {Wood boring is a feature of several insect species and is a major cause of severe and irreparable damage to trees. Adult females typically deposit their eggs on the stem surface under bark scales. The emerging hatchlings live within wood during their larval phase, avoiding possible predation, whilst continually boring and tunneling through wood until pupation. A study of wood boring by insects offers unique insights into the bioengineering principles that drive evolutionary adaptations. We show that larval mandibles of the coffee wood stem borer beetle (Xylotrechus quadripes: Cerambycidae) have a highly sharp cusp edge to initiate fractures in Arabica wood and a suitable shape to generate small wood chips that are suitable for digestion. Cuticle hardness at the tip is significantly enhanced through zinc-enrichment. A hollow architecture significantly reduces bending stresses at the mandibular base without compromising the structural integrity. Finite element model of the mandible showed highest stresses in the tip region; these decreased to significantly lower values at the start of the hollow section. A scaling model based on a fracture mechanics framework shows the importance of the mandible shape in generating optimal chip sizes. These findings contain general principles in tool design and put in focus interactions of insects and their woody hosts.},

abstract = {As bone is used in a dynamic mechanical environment, understanding the structural origins of its time-dependent mechanical behaviour – and the alterations in metabolic bone disease – is of interest. However, at the scale of the mineralized fibrillar matrix (nanometre-level), the nature of the strain-rate dependent mechanics is incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the fibrillar- and mineral-deformation behaviour in a murine model of Cushing's syndrome, used to understand steroid induced osteoporosis, using synchrotron small- and wide-angle scattering/diffraction combined with in situ tensile testing at three strain rates ranging from 10-4 to 10-1 s-1. We find that the effective fibril- and mineral-modulus and fibrillar-reorientation show no significant increase with strain-rate in osteoporotic bone, but increase significantly in normal (wild-type) bone. By applying a fibril-lamellar two-level structural model of bone matrix deformation to fit the results, we obtain indications that altered collagen-mineral interactions at the nanoscale – along with altered fibrillar orientation distributions – may be the underlying reason for this altered strain-rate sensitivity. Our results suggest that an altered strain-rate sensitivity of the bone matrix in osteoporosis may be one of the contributing factors to reduced mechanical competence in such metabolic bone disorders, and that increasing this sensitivity may improve biomechanical performance.},

abstract = {The effect of different elongation conditions on the crystalline structure and physical and mechanical properties of polyacrylonitrile/carbon nanotube (PAN/CNT) microfibers during the wet spinning process was studied. It turns out that the response of polymer chains in PAN/CNT and in PAN fibers to the stretching forces from jet stretching and steam drawing is different. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the crystalline domain size in steam-drawn PAN/CNT fibers is 1.5 times larger than in PAN fibers. CNTs alter the optimum stretching conditions, as they improve the crystalline structure of the PAN/CNT fibers at lower steam drawing ratios than PAN fibers, through nucleation of crystals on their surface. Synchrotron-radiation XRD studies revealed that the presence of CNTs improves the crystal orientation of PAN/CNT fibers significantly. In addition, steam drawing is more effective in improving the crystal orientation than jet stretching. The mechanical properties of PAN/CNT fibers have also been affected by steam drawing more than jet stretching. Multiwalled CNTs have the biggest impact on Young's modulus. The Young's modulus of PAN/CNT fibers could increase up to 19% higher than PAN fibers at specific stretching conditions, i.e., steam drawing ratio of 2.5. Better orientation of polymers and crystals in the fiber direction is the reason for the enhancement of Young's modulus. To our knowledge, the differences between the response of PAN/CNT and PAN fibers to stretching forces inside coagulation bath and after fiber coagulation as well as the difference in evolution of crystalline structure at different stretching stages has not been reported elsewhere.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the piezoresistivity of metal nanowire networks embedded in a polymer, which has been widely used as a highly-stretchable strain sensor, by varying the orientation distribution of nanowires. For simplicity, we assume the affine transform of the nanowire network upon stretching and compute the effective conductivity of the nanowire network by recognizing the percolation network connecting low and high voltage boundaries. Orientation-dependence is then studied firstly by varying the range of polar angle and secondly by changing the degree of alignment along loading direction. Since nanowires are embedded in thin nanowire-polymer film in most stretchable sensor applications, instead of having random orientation distribution over full solid angle, nanowires have a limited range of polar angle distribution around 90° (when the surface normal vector of a thin film is given as the zenith direction). We show that the gauge factor (relative resistance change over applied mechanical strain) decreases as the polar angle distribution gets narrower. We then study the effect of nanowire alignment on the piezoresistive response, by assuming partial alignment distribution along the tensile direction. We find that a wide range of the gauge factor, from negative to positive, appears as the initial partial alignment angle varies, and explained such response by analyzing the relative electrical path change between a pair of nanowires. Our study deepens the understanding on the percolation-network based piezoresistive sensors and provides a guideline for designing a stretchable strain sensor with the desired gauge factor.},

abstract = {Silks have been widely used as biomaterials due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and excellent mechanical properties. In the present work, native spider silk was used as organic template for controlled nucleation of hydroxyapatite (HA) nano-coating that can act as biomimetic interface. Different bio-inspired neutralization methods and process parameters were evaluated to optimize the silk functionalization. The morphology and chemical composition were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis and mechanical properties were studied through tensile tests. Results showed that the optimized protocol enabled a controlled and homogeneous nucleation of apatite nano-crystals while maintaining silk mechanical performances after mineralization. This study reports the optimization of a simple and effective bio-inspired nucleation process for precise nucleation of HA onto spider silk templates, suitable to develop high-performance hybrid interfaces for bone tissue engineering. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Recently, several chemical and physical treatments were developed to improve different properties of wood. Such treatments are applicable to many types of cellulose-based materials. Densification leads the group in terms of mechanical results and comprises a chemical treatment followed by a thermo-compression stage. First, chemicals selectively etch the matrix of lignin and hemicellulose. Then, thermo-compression increases the packing density of cellulose microfibrils boosting mechanical performance. In this paper, in comparison with the state-of-the-art for wood treatments we introduce an additional nano-reinforcemeent on densified giant reed to further improve the mechanical performance. The modified nanocomposite materials are stiffer, stronger, tougher and show higher fire resistance. After the addition of nanoparticles, no relevant structural modification is induced as they are located in the gaps between cellulose microfibrils. Their peculiar positioning could increase the interfacial adhesion energy and improve the stress transfer between cellulose microfibrils. The presented process stands as a viable solution to introduce nanoparticles as new functionalities into cellulose-based natural materials.},

abstract = {In this work we describe two different models for interpreting and predicting Reflection Electron Energy Loss (REEL) spectra and we present results of a study on metallic systems comparing their respective computational cost and accuracy. These approaches are the Monte Carlo (MC) method and the Numerical Solution (NS) of the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhr equations. The former is based on a statistical algorithm to sample the electron trajectories within the target material for describing the electron transport. The latter relies on the numerical solution of the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar equations using the invariant embedding method. Both methods receive the same input parameters to deal with the elastic and inelastic electron scattering. To test their capability of describing REEL experimental spectra, we use copper, silver, and gold as case studies. Our simulations include both bulk and surface plasmon contributions to the energy loss spectrum by using the effective electron energy loss functions and the relevant extensions to finite momenta. The agreement between MC and NS theoretical spectra with experimental data is remarkably good. Nevertheless, while we find that these approaches are comparable in accuracy, the computational cost of NS is several orders of magnitude lower than the widely used MC. Inputs, routines and data are enclosed with this manuscript via the Mendeley database.},

abstract = {The barb–barbule structure branching from a feather shaft is a basic unit of a bird feather, and the structure is intricately organized to form the feather vane, which plays an important role in keeping the feather's integrity during bird flight. In this paper, by coupling nonlinear large deformations of the barb and barbule, an analytical model of delaminating two neighboring barbs on the basis of critical-friction detaching criteria is developed. Considering the rotation and non-rotation of barb–barbule joints in the delamination, a rotatable model (LargeRM) and a non-rotatable model (LargeNRM) are treated to explain the rotation's contribution to toughening the feather vane. The results show that the predicted interlocking forces of un-detached barbules in the two models were linearly distributed during the delamination. Due to the rotatable barb–barbule joint, the critical detaching force and the elastic strain energy of the two neighboring barbs in the LargeRM are greater than those in the LargeNRM, and this indicates that the rotatable barb–barbule joint could enhance the in-plane delaminating toughness of the feather vane. The present model reveals the nonlinear barb delamination behavior and explains the rotation toughening mechanism of the barb–barbule joint in the barb delamination and further is used to design new bio-inspired interlocking materials, e.g., the feather-inspired Velcro fastener.},

Multibody dynamics simulations, validated by operando video recordings of the process, were employed to investigate modified ball motion regimes promoting the increase of the number of high-energy impacts. Moreover, experimental grinding of calcium fluoride powder was performed to assess the effect of milling time and jar-to-plate velocity ratio, through the evaluation of size and microstrain of the end product deduced from X-ray diffraction line profile analysis.},

abstract = {In the present work, hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles doped with Mg2+, Sr2+, and Zn2+ ions are developed by wet neutralization method and then sintered at 1,250°C to obtain bulk consolidated materials. Physicochemical and microstructural analyses show that the presence of doping ions in the HA structure induced the formation of $\beta$TCP as secondary phase, during the sintering process, and we found that this effect is depending on the stability of the various doping ions in the hydroxyapatite lattice itself. We also found that the formation of $\beta$TCP as secondary phase, in turn, confines the grain growth of HA induced by the high-temperature sintering process, thus leading to a strong increase of the flexural strength of the bulk materials, according to Hall-Petch-like law. Furthermore, we found that the doping ions enter also in the structure of the $\beta$TCP phase; besides the grain growth confinement, also the solubility and ion release ability of the final materials were enhanced. In addition to ameliorate the mechanical performance, the described phenomena also activate multiple biofunctionalities: (i) ability to upregulate various genes involved in the osteogenesis, as obtained by human adipose stem cells culture and evaluated by array technology; (ii) enhanced resistance to the adhesion and proliferation of Gram+ and Gram– bacterial strains. Hence, our results open a perspective for the use of sintered multiple ion-doped HA to develop ceramic biodevices, such as plates, screws, or other osteosynthesis media, with enhanced strength, osteointegrability, and the ability to prevent post-surgical infections.},

abstract = {Analogue gravitational systems are becoming an increasing popular way of studying the behaviour of quantum systems in curved spacetime. Setups based on ultracold quantum gases in particular, have been recently harnessed to explore the thermal nature of Hawking's and Unruh's radiation that was theoretically predicted almost 50 years ago. For solid state implementations, a promising system is graphene, in which a link between the Dirac-like low-energy electronic excitations and relativistic quantum field theories has been unveiled soon after its discovery. This link could be extended to the case of curved quantum field theory when the graphene sheet is shaped in a surface of constant negative curvature, known as Beltrami's pseudosphere. Here we provide numerical evidence that energetically stable negative curvature graphene surfaces can be realized. Owing to large-scale simulations, our geometrical realizations are characterized by a ratio between the carbon-carbon bond length and the pseudosphere radius small enough to allow the formation of an analog of a black hole event horizon. Additionally, from the energy dependence of the spatially resolved density of states, we infer some thermal properties of the corresponding gravitational system, which could be investigated using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy or optical near field spectroscopy. These findings pave the way to the realization of a solid-state system in which the curved spacetime dynamics of quantum many body systems can be investigated.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a few novel energetically and dynamically stable all-sp2 carbon-based architectures with low density obtained by augmenting planar three-coordinated uniform tessellations. Using geometrical packing arguments, we show that such arrangements satisfy the locally–jammed packing condition and represent some of the least dense structures of all-sp2 bonded carbon allotropes that could ever be synthesised. We fully characterize from first principles these new architectures, by assessing i) the electronic properties, such as the band structure and the density of states; ii) the dynamical characteristics, such as the phonon dispersion; and iii) the mechanical properties, such as the elastic constants and the stress–strain relationships. We compare our findings with already synthesised carbon-based materials, in particular graphene, and we find that in the lowest–density structures the mechanical rigidity is considerably depleted, while other specific mechanical characteristics, such as toughness and strength, are comparable to the relevant specific values of graphene. Furthermore, a flat band at the Fermi level emerges in the electronic band structure of the augmented geometries, which is a feature similarly appearing in Kagome lattices.},

abstract = {Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed phenomenon. Although its influence on cell's response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the widest group of transmembrane proteins in animals, which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors –in full agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels– and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell interaction.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on elastic metamaterials characterised by the presence of wide sub-wavelength band gap. In most cases, such mechanical property is strictly connected to the periodic repetition of the unit cell. Nonetheless, the strict periodicity requirement could represent a drawback. In this paper, we present a design strategy for aperiodic elastic metamaterials in order to achieve the same performances as for the periodic counterparts. This is done by exploiting the concept of separation of modes for different building blocks, arranged in aperiodic fashion. A theoretical explanation is provided, as well as numerical simulations; the concept is validated by means of a set of experimental tests on prototypes that are realized via additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Nanocomposites built from polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising class of materials. Computer modeling can provide nanoscale views of the polymer–CNT interface, which are much needed to foster the manufacturing and development of such materials. However, setting up periodic nanocomposite models is a challenging task. Here we propose a computational workflow based on Molecular Dynamics simulations. We demonstrate its capabilities and showcase its applications, focusing on two existing nanocomposite materials: polystyrene (PS) with CNT and polyether ether ketone with CNT. The models provide insights into the polymer crystallization inside CNTs. Furthermore, the PS+CNT nanocomposite models are mechanically tested and able to predict an enhancement in Young's modulus due to the addition of highly dispersed CNTs. We accompany those results with experimental tests and provide a prediction model based on Dynamic Quantized Fracture Mechanics theory. Our study proposes representative simulations of polymer–CNT nanocomposites as promising tools to guide the rational design of this class of materials.},

abstract = {Efficient production of artificial spider silk fibers with properties that match its natural counterpart has still not been achieved. Recently, a biomimetic process for spinning recombinant spider silk proteins (spidroins) was presented, in which important molecular mechanisms involved in native spider silk spinning were recapitulated. However, drawbacks of these fibers included inferior mechanical properties and problems with low resistance to aqueous environments. In this work, we show that >5 h incubation of the fibers, in a collection bath of 500 mM NaAc and 200 mM NaCl, at pH 5 results in fibers that do not dissolve in water or phosphate buffered saline, which implies that the fibers can be used for applications that involve wet/humid conditions. Furthermore, incubation in the collection bath improved the strain at break and was associated with increased $\beta$-sheet content, but did not affect the fiber morphology. In summary, we present a simple way to improve artificial spider silk fiber strain at break and resistance to aqueous solvents.},

abstract = {In Nature, biological materials such as nacre, bone, and dentin display an enhanced mechanical strength due to their structure characterized by hard inclusions embedded in a soft matrix. This structure has inspired the design of artificial materials with optimized properties. Thus, for given the mechanical properties of matrix and inclusions, it is fundamental to understand how the global observables, essentially strength, and ultimate strain are determined by the geometrical parameters of the inclusions. In this paper, we address this question by extending the two-dimensional random fuse model, which has been widely used to extract statistical properties of fracture processes, to the case of staggered stiff inclusions. We thus investigate numerically how emergent mechanical properties can be optimized by tuning geometrical dimensions and the arrangement of the inclusions. To do this, we adopt an optimization procedure based on an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently explore the parameter space and to determine the most favorable geometrical features of the inclusions for improved strength or ductility, or both. Various lattice sizes and volume fractions are considered. Depending on inclusion sizes and aspect ratios, composite strength or ultimate strain can be maximized, with the Pareto front for simultaneous optimization of the two being interpolated by a simple power law. Characteristic exponents for damage avalanche distributions are found to vary with respect to homogeneous structures, indicating increased fracture ductility simply due to optimized geometrical features. Our study indicates the possibility through structural optimization of creating staggered composites that allow significant advantages in terms of weight reduction and fuel consumption in automotive applications.},

In this work, single wall carboxylated carbon nanotubes (SWCNT-COOH) were incorporated within the roots of living plants of Arabidopsis thaliana. This biogenic synthetic route produced a bionic composite material made of root components and SWCNT-COOH. The synthesis was possible exploiting the transport processes existing in the plant roots. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements showed that SWCNT-COOH entered the vascular bundles of A. thaliana roots localizing within xylem vessels. SWCNT-COOH preserved their electrical properties when embedded inside the root matrix, both at a microscopic level and a macroscopic level, and did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of A. thaliana roots.},

abstract = {Due to a widespread number of examples, biological hierarchical structures have been studied for years, founding that surface properties are strictly correlated to the surface roughness. Since friction appears to be a multiscale phenomenon and hierarchy optimizes the macroscopic mechanical properties of bodies, it may be of great interest to develop a model to predict friction of structures with hierarchical surfaces. Thus, we propose an analytical model to describe anisotropic friction, adhesion and wear of hierarchical surfaces. The model describes friction between two generic rough surfaces in contact, sliding one against the other. Then, it has been extended to adhesion, wear and finally to multiple hierarchical levels to obtain the global frictional response.},

Considered to be detrimental for the performance of photovoltaic kesterite, the order-disorder transition appears to be beneficial for thermopower. Experimental data and ab initio calculations explain the origin of this enhancement: the increase of crystal symmetry in the disordered polymorph leads to a favorable electronic band structure characterized by flat and converged bands. At the transition, a sharp drop in mobility and increase in carrier concentration experimentally prove this mechanism of Seebeck enhancement. This, other than providing a new understanding of the material, can cast light on some profitable mechanisms to enhance the thermoelectric performance. Additionally, the increase in Seebeck provides an efficient tool to observe the transition and possibly to quantify disorder.},

abstract = {Context. Until recently, camera networks designed for monitoring fireballs worldwide were not fully automated, implying that in case of a meteorite fall, the recovery campaign was rarely immediate. This was an important limiting factor as the most fragile - hence precious - meteorites must be recovered rapidly to avoid their alteration. Aims. The Fireball Recovery and InterPlanetary Observation Network (FRIPON) scientific project was designed to overcome this limitation. This network comprises a fully automated camera and radio network deployed over a significant fraction of western Europe and a small fraction of Canada. As of today, it consists of 150 cameras and 25 European radio receivers and covers an area of about 1.5 × 106km2. Methods. The FRIPON network, fully operational since 2018, has been monitoring meteoroid entries since 2016, thereby allowing the characterization of their dynamical and physical properties. In addition, the level of automation of the network makes it possible to trigger a meteorite recovery campaign only a few hours after it reaches the surface of the Earth. Recovery campaigns are only organized for meteorites with final masses estimated of at least 500 g, which is about one event per year in France. No recovery campaign is organized in the case of smaller final masses on the order of 50 to 100 g, which happens about three times a year; instead, the information is delivered to the local media so that it can reach the inhabitants living in the vicinity of the fall. Results. Nearly 4000 meteoroids have been detected so far and characterized by FRIPON. The distribution of their orbits appears to be bimodal, with a cometary population and a main belt population. Sporadic meteors amount to about 55% of all meteors. A first estimate of the absolute meteoroid flux (mag < -5; meteoroid size ≥∼1 cm) amounts to 1250/yr/106km2. This value is compatible with previous estimates. Finally, the first meteorite was recovered in Italy (Cavezzo, January 2020) thanks to the PRISMA network, a component of the FRIPON science project.},

abstract = {The fabrication of multifunctional materials that interface with living environments is a problem of great interest. A variety of structural design concepts have been integrated with functional materials to form biodevices and surfaces for health monitoring. In particular, approaches based on kirigami-inspired cuts can engineer flexibility in materials through the creation of patterned defects. Here, the fabrication of a biodegradable and biofunctional "silk kirigami" material is demonstrated. Mechanically flexible, free-standing, optically transparent, large-area biomaterial sheets with precisely defined and computationally designed microscale cuts can be formed using a single-step photolithographic process. Using modeling techniques, it is shown how cuts can generate remarkable "self-shielding" leading to engineered elastic behavior and deformation. As composites with conducting polymers, flexible, intrinsically electroactive sheets can be formed. Importantly, the silk kirigami sheets are biocompatible, can serve as substrates for cell culture, and be proteolytically resorbed. The unique properties of silk kirigami suggest a host of applications as transient, "green", functional biointerfaces, and flexible bioelectronics.},

abstract = {Spider silks present extraordinary mechanical properties, which have attracted the attention of material scientists in recent decades. In particular, the strength and the toughness of these protein-based materials outperform the ones of many man-made fibers. Unfortunately, despite the huge interest, there is an absence of statistical investigation on the mechanical properties of spider silks and their related size effects due to the length of the fibers. Moreover, several spider silks have never been mechanically tested. Accordingly, in this work, we measured the mechanical properties and computed the Weibull parameters for different spider silks, some of them unknown in the literature. We also measured the mechanical properties at different strain rates for the dragline of the species Cupiennius salei. For the same species, we measured the strength and Weibull parameters at different fiber lengths. In this way, we obtained the spider silk scaling laws directly and according to Weibull's prediction. Both length and strain rates affect the mechanical properties of spider silk, as rationalized by Weibull's statistics.},

abstract = {Phononic materials are artificial composites with unprecedented abilities to control acoustic waves in solids. Their performance is mainly governed by their architecture, determining frequency ranges in which wave propagation is inhibited. However, the dynamics of phononic materials also depends on the mechanical and material properties of their constituents. In the case of viscoelastic constituents, such as most polymers, it is challenging to correctly predict the actual dynamic behavior of real phononic structures. Existing studies on this topic either lack experimental evidence or are limited to specific materials and architectures in restricted frequency ranges. A general framework is developed and employed to characterize the dynamics of polymer phononic materials with different architectures made of both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers, presenting qualitatively different viscoelastic behaviors. Through a comparison of experimental results with numerical predictions, the reliability of commonly used elastic and viscoelastic material models is evaluated in broad frequency ranges. Correlations between viscous effects and the two main band-gap formation mechanisms in phononic materials are revealed, and experimentally verified guidelines on how to correctly predict their dissipative response are proposed in a computationally efficient way. Overall, this work provides comprehensive guidelines for the extension of phononics modeling to applications involving dissipative viscoelastic materials.},

abstract = {The modeling of the viability decay of viruses in sessile droplets is addressed considering a droplet sitting on a smooth surface characterized by a specific contact angle. To investigate, at prescribed temperature, how surface energy of the material and ambient humidity cooperate to determine the virus viability, we propose a model which involves the minimum number of thermodynamically relevant parameters. In particular, by considering a saline water droplet (one salt) as the simplest approximation of real solutions (medium and natural/artificial saliva), the evaporation is described by a first-order time-dependent nonlinear differential equation properly rearranged to obtain the contact angle evolution as the sole unknown function. The analyses were performed for several contact angles and two typical droplet sizes of interest in real situations by assuming constant ambient temperature and relative humidity in the range 0–100%. The results of the simulations, given in terms of time evolution of salt concentration, vapor pressure, and droplet volume, elucidate some previously not yet well-understood dynamics, demonstrating how three main regimes—directly implicated in nontrivial trends of virus viability and to date only highlighted experimentally—can be recognized as the function of relative humidity. By recalling the concept of cumulative dose of salts (CD), to account for the effect of the exposition of viruses to salt concentration on virus viability, we show how the proposed approach could suggest a chart of a virus fate by predicting its survival time at a given temperature as a function of the relative humidity and contact angle. We found a good agreement with experimental data for various enveloped viruses and predicted in particular for the Phi6 virus, a surrogate of coronavirus, the characteristic U-shaped dependence of viability on relative humidity. Given the generality of the model and once experimental data are available that link the vulnerability of a certain virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, to the concentrations of salts or other substances in terms of CD, it is felt that this approach could be employed for antivirus strategies and protocols for the prediction/reduction of human health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.},

While strength and toughness are often self-excluding properties in manmade materials, they can be efficiently combined by nature, which provides source of inspiration for novel materials design. Herein this paper, we pursue a bio-inspired approach, based on the introduction of a mechanical sink, such as a running knot, to improve the toughness modulus of highperformance polymeric microfibres. These are then enriched with additional smart features, such as a viscoelastic coating, surface roughening or a combination of those, to amplify the beneficial effect of the knot introduction. The role played by all such features on the mechanical performances of the prepared fibre samples, namely load at failure and toughness modulus increase, is then evaluated through a statistical technique, known as correspondence analysis (CA). While this exploratory analysis is widely adopted in biology, ecology, neuroscience or genetics, applications in structural or mechanical engineering are still rare. Here, we show thatCAcan be a powerful tool for the design of materials provided with enhanced toughness without losing strength.},

Four process factors were considered: the number of degumming baths, the process time, the process temperature, and the salt concentration.

abstract = {Silk fibroin is a protein with a unique combination of properties and is widely studied for biomedical applications. The extraction of fibroin (degumming) from the silk filament impacts the properties of the outcoming material. The degumming can be conducted with different procedures. Among them, the most used and studied procedure in the research field is the alkali degumming with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). In this study, by the use of a statistical method, namely, design of experiment (DOE), we characterized the Na2CO3 degumming, taking into consideration the main process factors involved and changing them within a selected range of values. We considered the process temperature and time, the salt concentration, and the number of baths used, testing the impact of these variables on the fibroin properties by building empirical models. These models not only took into consideration the direct effect of the process factors but also their combined effect, which are not conventionally detectable with other methods. The weight loss and the amount of sericin removed in the process were determined and used as a measure of the effectiveness of the process. The secondary structure, the molecular weight, the diameter of fibers, and their morphology and mechanical properties were studied with the intent to correlate the macroscopical properties with the structural changes. We report, for the first time, the possibility to effectively remove all sericin from the silk fibroin using Na2CO3, using a process that requires less salt, water, and energy, in comparison with the standard alkali protocol, making this technique overall more environmentally sustainable; in addition, we have demonstrated the possibility to tune the material properties by varying the degumming conditions and even to optimize them with empirical statistically based equations that allow one to directly set the optimal process parameters. The major effect on the macroscopical properties (such as the ultimate strength and Young's modulus) has been proved to be correlated with the removal of sericin instead of the microstructural variations. Finally, a ready-to-use table with a set of optimized degumming procedures to maximize or minimize the studied properties was provided.},

abstract = {Supercritical CO2 (Sc-CO2) drying has been recognized as a promising low temperature drying technique for food products. In this regard, this work focuses on the feasibility of Sc-CO2 drying of apple's slices: both the microbiological stability and mechanical behavior of the test product after the process have been investigated in dependence from different process parameters, namely drying time, pressurization time, and depressurization time. The microbiological stability was determined for both inoculated pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes) and naturally present microorganisms (yeasts and molds, mesophilic bacteria and spores and Enterobacteriaceae). Results demonstrated a complete inactivation of pathogenic bacteria under the detection limit (<1 CFU/g) just after the pressurization (10 min) and depressurization (20 min) phases. After the same steps, a strong reduction of vegetative bacteria and yeasts and molds was also observed in comparison with air drying and freeze drying samples. As regards the mechanical behavior, the Young Modulus, measured before and after the CO2 processes to provide a measurement of samples' stiffness, resulted dependent from the final water activity, but independent from the length of pressurization and depressurization phases at longer drying time. Overall, these results are promising to foster the development of the technology at industrial level.},

abstract = {In this article, we report the observation of an air-encapsulating elastic mechanism of Dandelion spherical seed heads, namely blowballs, when submerged underwater. This peculiarity seems to be fortuitous since Taraxacum is living outside water; nevertheless, it could become beneficial for a better survival under critical conditions, e.g. of temporary flooding. The scaling of the volume of the air entrapped suggests its fractal nature with a dimension of 2.782 and a fractal air volume fraction of 4.82 × 10−2 m0.218, resulting in nominal air volume fractions in the range of 14–23%. This aspect is essential for the optimal design of bioinspired materials made up of Dandelion-like components. The miniaturization of such components leads to an increase in the efficiency of the air encapsulation up to the threshold (efficiency = 1) achieved for an optimal critical size. Thus, the optimal design is accomplished using small elements, with the optimal size, rather than using larger elements in a lower number. The described phenomenon, interesting per se, also brings bioinspired insights toward new related technological solutions for underwater air-trapping and air-bubbles transportation, e.g. the body surface of a man could allow an apnea (air consumption of 5–10 l/min) of about 10 min if it is covered by a material made up of a periodic repetition of Dandelion components of diameter ≅18 $\mu$m and having a total thickness of about 3–6 cm.},

To throw light upon the unusual behavior of the developed self-propelled liquid marbles, we propose a model which takes into account skimming of the liquid marbles over the water surface similar to that inherent to flying water lily beetle and the so-called helicopter effect, causing a liquid marble to rise above the level of the water surface when rotating.},

As such, silks' material properties and the fear and fascination surrounding the animals that spin it are seen to play an important role in the development of many cultures and societies. More recently this is even more so with the formalization of this inspiration in scientific and technical communities through biomimetics. The aim of this work is to reflect on the beginnings of our relationship with silk and discuss concepts associated with spider silks and webs in ancient Greek and Roman times whilst comparing this with our current understanding of the field. In this way, ancient texts, namely Greek and Latin ones, are found to intersect with modern advanced disciplines, ranging from architecture to medicine to physics. This allows us not only to understand how natural observation has evolved from antiquity to today, but also how such a highly interdisciplinary research network has been spun by some shared conceptual threads.},

abstract = {The thermo-mechanical properties of carbon black reinforced natural and styrene butadiene rubbers are investigated under rapid adiabatic conditions. Eleven carbon black grades with varying surface area and structure properties at 40 parts per hundred (phr) loading are studied and the unreinforced equivalents are included for reference. The results show a strong correlation of the modulus, mechanical hysteresis, temperature rise and calculated crystallinity of the rubbers measured in tensile extension with strain amplification factors. This highlights the influence of matrix overstraining on microstructural deformations of the rubber upon extension. The strain amplification factors are calculated via the Guth-Gold equation directly from carbon black type and loading, allowing a correlation of the fundamental morphological properties of carbon black with thermal and mechanical properties of rubbers upon extension. Analysis of the thermal measurements of the rubber compounds upon extension and retraction and contrasting between crystallizing and non-crystallizing rubbers reveals that a substantial irreversible heat generation is present upon extension of the rubber compounds. These irreversible effects most likely originate from microstructural damage mechanisms which have been proposed to account for the Mullins Effect in particle reinforced rubbers.},

abstract = {Adherent cells are able to actively generate internal forces, channelled by cytoskeletal protein filaments and transmitted through transmembrane receptors to the surrounding environment by means of focal adhesions. Cells also dynamically interact with extracellular matrix by sensing external chemo-mechanical stimuli and then inducing formation of stress fibres mediated by polymerization/de-polymerization processes which continuously redesign the interplay between structural organization and contractility activities in the cytoskeleton, so orchestrating selected signal pathways at the basis of many important cell's physiological functions like adhesion, migration and division. Despite chemo- and duro-taxis have been intensively studied in the last years to understand how cells move on a substrate, their polarization and reorientation – observed during gastrulation, wound healing and morphogenesis – are only partially understood. By starting from the evidence highlighted in some recent studies that cells reorient in response to substrata deformation by essentially obeying a pure mechanical interaction, we propose to interpret the seeming overall cells' rotation resulting from the reconfiguration of their cytoskeleton – here named mechanotropism – as a nonlinear optimization problem in which the adherent cell aims to align along directions leading it to minimize a physically coherent measure of work spent to deform the elastic substrate while retaining a prescribed level of homeostatic contractile force. To do this, the single-cell is simply modelled as a finite size contractile force dipole that acts on the boundary of a half-space perturbed by applied point loads. The effects of fences of forces acting orthogonally and tangentially on the boundary of the adhesion medium and encircling the cell are then investigated, so obtaining solutions that predict multiple non-trivial cell polarizations as functions of number, direction, relative magnitude and distance from the cell-dipole of the forces, as well as of the substrate's Poisson ratio, with unprecedented outcomes under the hypothesis of auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson ratio) materials. The results lead to envisage that the proposed theoretical model might contribute to unveil the mechanobiological principles ruling in vivo cells orientation processes by guiding the design of novel experimental strategies and to conceive new mechanics-based markers for guessing cells' pathological conditions from their mechanotropism.},

abstract = {We propose a simple general framework to predict folding, native states, energy barriers, protein unfolding, as well as mutation induced diseases and other protein structural analyses. The model should not be considered as an alternative to classical approaches (Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo) because it neglects low scale details and rather focuses on global features of proteins and structural information. We aim at the description of phenomena that are out of the range of classical molecular modeling approaches due to the large computational cost: multimolecular interactions, cyclic behavior under variable external interactions, and similar. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a real case, we focus on the folding and unfolding behavior of tropoelastin and its mutations. Specifically, we derive a discrete mechanical model whose structure is deduced based on a coarse graining approach that allows us to group the amino acids sequence in a smaller number of ‘equivalent' masses. Nearest neighbor energy terms are then introduced to reproduce the interaction of such amino acid groups. Nearest and non-nearest neighbor energy terms, inter and intra functional blocks are phenomenologically added in the form of Morse potentials. As we show, the resulting system reproduces important properties of the folding-unfolding mechanical response, including the monotonic and cyclic force-elongation behavior, representing a physiologically important information for elastin. The comparison with the experimental behavior of mutated tropoelastin confirms the predictivity of the model. Statement of significance: Classical approaches to the study of phenomena at the molecular scale such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) represent an incredible tool to unveil mechanical and conformational properties of macromolecules, in particular for biological and medical applications. On the other hand, due to the computational cost, the time and spatial scales are limited. Focusing of the real case of tropoelastin, we propose a new approach based on a careful coarse graining of the system, able to describe the overall properties of the macromolecule and amenable of extension to larger scale effects (protein bundles, protein-protein interactions, cyclic loading). The comparison with tropoelastin behavior, also for mutations, is very promising.},

abstract = {Research on phononic crystal architectures has produced many interesting designs in the past years, with useful wave manipulation properties. However, not all of the proposed designs can lead to convenient realizations for practical applications, and only a limited number of them have actually been tested experimentally to verify numerical estimations and demonstrate their feasibility. In this work, we propose a combined numerical-experimental procedure to characterize the dynamic behavior of metamaterials, starting from a simplified 2D design to a real 3D manufactured structure. To do this, we consider a new design of a resonator-type geometry for a phononic crystal, and verify its wave filtering properties in wave propagation experiments. The proposed geometry exploits a circular distribution of cavities in a homogeneous material, leading to a central resonator surrounded by thin ligaments and an external matrix. Parametric simulations are performed to determine the optimal thickness of this design, leading to a large full band gap in the kHz range. Full-field experimental characterization of the resulting phononic crystal using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is then performed, showing excellent agreement with numerically predicted band gap properties and with their resulting effects on propagating waves. The outlined procedure can serve as a useful step towards a standardization of metamaterial development and validation procedures.},

abstract = {Extreme adhesion mechanisms are shown in a wide number of situations in nature, from structures of single cells and spider web anchorages to hierarchical organization of ends and pads of insects and reptiles. With this in mind, we here propose a general formulation of multiple peeling theory accounting for geometrical and constitutive nonlinearities, i.e. large deformations and hyperelasticity. Pre-stress of adherent tracts and different initial V-shaped configurations of the tapes have been also included in the modelling. By following an analytical approach, closed-form solutions and explicit formulas were given for predicting pull-off critical forces and optimality conditions maximizing the adhesion strength, as well as for tracing the evolution of the delamination process, from the detaching onset to its progressive behaviour. Kendall and previous constitutively linear multiple peeling theory approaches were all recovered as limit cases, gaining insights into the role played by nonlinearities and pre-stress and also demonstrating – with mathematically rigorous arguments – the asymptotic character of the detaching phenomenon observed experimentally. Example applications and simple key tests were provided to show the effectiveness of the approach, which could help to interpret peeling in nature and to design materials with enhanced adhesive properties.},

The variation in the pitch lengths regulates the strain induced in capped graphene revealed by scanning probe techniques, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation. The atomistic visualization elucidates asymmetric straining of C-C bonds over the corrugated architecture resulting in distinct friction dissipation with respect to the groove axis.

abstract = {Using an analytical solution of the Euler's Elastica, we stumbled upon peculiar shapes of a cantilever beam subject to a large value of shear follower force at the free end. Intrigued by whether such shapes existed or not, we set out to realise an experimental apparatus to validate our predictions. Attaining such system, in reality, is not at all a trivial task. Indeed, it has represented an experimental challenge for decades, due to the emergence of unstable configurations. After various attempts, we were finally able to conceive and realise a device capable of generating a transverse follower force to the beam via air-thrust. We compared the measurement of the forces and the deformation of the beam obtained experimentally with the analytical solution of the Euler's Elastica in dimensionless form. Since the experiments are quasi-static, the aerodynamic effect induced by the air flow are negligible; this is confirmed by the agreement between the experimental results and both theoretical and numerical predictions. During the experiments, we observed a high susceptibility to perturbations around a dimensionless load of 41.15. We used finite element simulations with an explicit time integration scheme to carry out a stability analysis. Our analysis confirmed the appearance of an unstable configuration for a load of 40.5. Therefore, by carefully tuning the apparatus, we could reach load values higher than the unstable load, at around 120. For such levels of forces, the solution of the Elastica prescribes hook-like shapes that we show experimentally in this paper. These results can find several applications, for instance, the design of soft-actuators, the realisation of more efficient drilling pipes for underwater, or underground, well or the design of biomedical equipment, such as catheters.},

abstract = {The quest for novel designs for lightweight phononic crystals and elastic metamaterials with wide low-frequency band gaps has proven to be a significant challenge in recent years. In this context, lattice-type materials represent a promising solution, providing both lightweight properties and significant possibilities of tailoring mechanical and dynamic properties. Additionally, lattice structures also enable the generation of hierarchical architectures, in which basic constitutive elements with different characteristic length scales can be combined. In this work, we propose 1D- and 2D-periodic phononic crystals made of spatial frames inspired by a spider web-based architecture. Specifically, hierarchical plane structures based on a combination of frames with a variable cross-section are proposed and exploited to open and enhance band gaps with respect to their non-hierarchical counterparts. Our results show that hierarchy is effective in broadening existing band gaps as well as opening new full band gaps in non-hierarchical periodic structures.},

abstract = {Living systems are built of multiscale-composites: materials formed of components with different properties that are assembled in complex micro- and nano-structures. Such biological multiscale-composites often show outstanding physical properties that are unachieved by artificial materials. A major scientific goal is thus to understand the assembly processes and the relationship between structure and function in order to reproduce them in a new generation of biomimetic high-performance materials. Here, we tested how the assembly of spider silk nano-fibres (i.e.glue coated 0.5 $\mu$m thick fibres produced by so-called piriform glands) into different micro-structures correlates with mechanical performance by empirically and numerically exploring the mechanical behaviour of line anchors in an orb weaver, a hunting spider and two ancient web builders. We demonstrate that the anchors of orb weavers exhibit outstanding mechanical robustness with minimal material use by the indirect attachment of the silk line to the substrate through a soft domain (‘bridge'). This principle can be used to design new artificial high-performance attachment systems.},

abstract = {Previous research into the friction behaviour of elastomers has typically focused on the effects of velocity, contact pressure, counter surface and lubrication on the coefficient of friction. O-ring type elastomer seals are common in many different industries. Friction plays a critical role during the setting and in service of these components. An experimental O-ring friction testing rig has been developed that can measure the effects of sliding speed and hydrostatic pressure on elastomer friction. Finite element analysis (FEA) packages can adopt fixed friction coefficients or ones that are pressure dependent. For the latter case, the dependence of the frictional behaviour is typically obtained from the instantaneous stress response at any given pressure and then related to the normal force response. The friction rig described in this paper uses industry standard dimensions for the O-ring gland, the pre-compression levels, extrusion gap size and pressure rating. The coefficient of friction is derived by dividing the measured friction force by the normal force, which was determined using an FEA modelling approach, as it could not be measured directly. Finally, a relationship between the frictional velocity and surface roughness is obtained in order to provide a frequency dependent Coefficient of Friction (CoF) that is easily translatable between surfaces.},

abstract = {Purposes. Advancements in medical technology have enabled medical specialists to resolve significant problems concerning tendon injuries. However, despite the latest improvements, surgical tendon repair remains challenging. This study aims to explore the capabilities of the current state-of-the-art technologies for implantable devices. Methods. After performing extensive patent landscaping and literature review, an anchored tissue fixation device was deemed the most suitable candidate. This design was firstly investigated numerically, realizing a Finite Element Model of the device anchored to two swine tendons stumps, to simulate its application on a severed tendon. Two different hook designs, both bio-inspired, were tested while retaining the same device geometry and anchoring strategy. Then, the applicability of a 3D-printed prototype was tested on swine tendons. Finally, the device-tendon stumps ensemble was subjected to uniaxial tensile tests. Results. The results show that the investigated device enables a better load distribution during the immobilized limb period in comparison to standard suture-based approaches, yet it still presents several design flaws. Conclusions. The current implantable solutions do not ensure an optimal result in terms of strength recovery. This and other weak points of the currently available proposals will serve as a starting point for future works on bio-inspired implantable devices for tendon repair.},

abstract = {Cu-Zn disorder is known to deeply affect kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) due to the low temperature order-disorder phase transition, leading to a random occupation of the two cations in the shared crystallographic planes. This defect complex has been extensively studied in the thin film photovoltaic sector, with considerable efforts in developing methods to quantify disorder. In this study, a preliminary investigation of thermoelectric properties in temperature for thin film CZTS is presented. It is found that Cu-Zn disorder enhances both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. This can positively affect the thermoelectric performance, showing a mechanism of potential interest for a broad class of quaternary chalcogenides. The order-disorder transition is clearly visible in the electronic properties. This feature is repeatable, with samples from different preparations and groups showing consistent results, qualitatively suggesting electronic measurements as possible methods to quantify disorder. Furthermore, the reversibility of the transition allows the electronic properties to be tuned via specific thermal treatments, pointing to interesting applications in tunable electronics.},

The review analyzes papers written from 2010 onward on injectable materials/systems used/proposed for the regenerative and combinatorial therapies of SCI and discusses the in vivo models that have been used to validate them.},

abstract = {Functionally graded porous (FGP) plates have been introduced as modern structural members which open a new window to optimal and functional designs. Despite the need to study the effect of graded porosity on the mechanical behavior of FGP plates, it is necessary to consider the very extensive and valuable literature in plate field, presenting remarkable closed-form solutions. Hence, this paper aims to answer where is possible to implement the available exact solutions for the analysis of FGP plates. The special distinction of FGP plates, graded porosity, is reflected in their stiffnesses and moments of inertia coefficients. Here 12 different functionalities of porosity distribution along the thickness are considered and a set of explicit formulations for evaluating these coefficients are presented to be substituted in already provided analytical solutions. Many examples including bending and free vibration of thin and thick FGP plates are exhibited and the influence of the type of porosity distribution is discussed in details. This work can be considered as a guideline for designers to evaluate the effect of graded porosity based on the cornerstone of the huge number of solutions in the precious literature of plate theories.},

abstract = {Material platforms based on interaction between organic and inorganic phases offer enormous potential to develop materials that can recreate the structural and functional properties of biological systems. However, the capability of organic-mediated mineralizing strategies to guide mineralization with spatial control remains a major limitation. Here, we report on the integration of a protein-based mineralizing matrix with surface topographies to grow spatially guided mineralized structures. We reveal how well-defined geometrical spaces defined within the organic matrix by the surface topographies can trigger subtle changes in single nanocrystal co-alignment, which are then translated to drastic changes in mineralization at the microscale and macroscale. Furthermore, through systematic modifications of the surface topographies, we demonstrate the possibility of selectively guiding the growth of hierarchically mineralized structures. We foresee that the capacity to direct the anisotropic growth of such structures would have important implications in the design of biomineralizing synthetic materials to repair or regenerate hard tissues.},

Plasma-treated rubbers were introduced into two different types of concrete. Mechanical tests highlighted that Portland concrete composites filled with N2/H2 plasma-treated rubber had increased flexural strength, toughness, and compression strength compared to composites containing untreated rubber. A scaling law is also proposed to qualitatively discriminate between related effects due to topological/roughness or intrinsic/chemical adhesion modifications. Plasma treatment can improve both intrinsic adhesion and roughness of the rubber–cement interface and thus the overall concrete strength and toughness.},

The versatility of such a system mainly derives from its variable geometry, which can be effectively used to design phononic crystals, thus inhibiting wave propagation in wide frequency ranges. In this work, the design of spider web-inspired single-phase phononic crystals through selective variation of thread radii and the addition of point masses is proposed, determined through the use of optimization techniques. The obtained results show that spider web geometry displays a rich vibration spectrum, which by varying its the geometric characteristics and adding localized masses can be tailored to manipulate wave modes, and the resulting two-dimensional phononic crystals present wide complete band gaps generated by Bragg scattering and local resonances.},

The six-fold symmetry of the perforations makes the medium isotropic in the plane. Remarkably, the mesoscale interaction between the first- and second-level cuts enables the attainment of a value of the Poisson's ratio close to the minimum reachable limit of -1. The effective properties of the hierarchical auxetic structure are determined numerically, considering both a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions and a finite structure containing a large number of repeating cells. Further, results of the numerical study are validated experimentally on a polymeric specimen with appropriately arranged rank-two cuts, tested under uniaxial tension. We envisage that the proposed hierarchical design can be useful in numerous engineering applications exploiting an extreme auxetic effect.},

The designed BMS consists of a motif of laminin $\alpha$-chain-derived, called IK peptide, and type IV collagen covalently bound to the silk fibroin (SF) by using EDC/NHS coupling and a Cu-free click chemistry reaction, respectively. Silk fibroin was chosen as the main component of the BMS because it is versatile and biocompatible, induces an in vivo favorable bioresponse, and moreover can be functionalized with different methods. The chemical structure of BMS was analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared, cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, and colorimetric assay. The SF and BMS solutions were cross-linked by sonication to form hydrogels or casted to make films in order to evaluate and compare the early adhesion and viability of MRC5 cells.

abstract = {We report that few graphene flakes embedded into polymer matrices can be mechanically stretched to relatively large deformation (>1%) in an efficient way by adopting a particular ladder-like morphology consisting of consecutive mono-, bi-, tri-, and four-layer graphene units. In this type of flake architecture, all of the layers adhere to the surrounding polymer inducing similar deformation on the individual graphene layers, preventing interlayer sliding and optimizing the strain transfer efficiency. We have exploited Raman spectroscopy to quantify this effect from a mechanical standpoint. The finite element method and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to interpret the above experimental findings. The results suggest that a step pyramid-like architecture of a flake can be ideal for efficient loading of layered materials embedded into a polymer and that there are two prevailing mechanisms that govern axial stress transfer, namely, interfacial shear transfer and axial transmission through the ends. This concept can be easily applied to other two-dimensional materials and related van der Waals heterostructures fabricated either by mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition by appropriate patterning. This work opens new perspectives in numerous applications, including high volume fraction composites, flexible electronics, and straintronic devices.},

abstract = {Aquatic predatory insects, like the nymphs of a dragonfly, use rapid movements to catch their prey and it presents challenges in terms of movements due to drag forces. Dragonfly nymphs are known to be voracious predators with structures and movements that are yet to be fully understood. Thus, we examine two main mouthparts of the dragonfly nymph (Libellulidae: Insecta: Odonata) that are used in prey capturing and cutting the prey. To observe and analyze the preying mechanism under water, we used high-speed photography and, electron microscopy. The morphological details suggest that the prey-capturing labium is a complex grasping mechanism with additional sensory organs that serve some functionality. The time taken for the protraction and retraction of labium during prey capture was estimated to be 187 ± 54 ms, suggesting that these nymphs have a rapid prey mechanism. The Young's modulus and hardness of the mandibles were estimated to be 9.1 ± 1.9 GPa and 0.85 ± 0.13 GPa, respectively. Such mechanical properties of the mandibles make them hard tools that can cut into the exoskeleton of the prey and also resistant to wear. Thus, studying such mechanisms with their sensory capabilities provides a unique opportunity to design and develop bioinspired underwater deployable mechanisms.},

abstract = {The disruptive nature of water presents a significant challenge when designing synthetic adhesives that maintain functionality in wet conditions. However, many animal adhesives can withstand high humidity or underwater conditions, and some are even enhanced by them. An understudied mechanism in such systems is the influence of material plasticization by water to induce adhesive work through deformation. Cribellate silk is a dry adhesive used by particular spiders to capture moving prey. It presents as a candidate for testing the water plasticization model as it can remain functional at high humidity despite lacking an aqueous component. We performed herein tensile and adhesion tests on cribellate threads from the spider, Hickmania troglodytes; a spider that lives within wet cave environments. We found that the work of adhesion of its cribellate threads increased as the axial fibre deformed during pull-off experiments. This effect was enhanced when the silk was wetted and as spider body size increased. Dry threads on the other hand were stiff with low adhesion. We rationalized our experiments by a series of scaling law models. We concluded that these cribellate threads operate best when the nanofibrils and axial fibers both contribute to adhesion. Design of future synthetic materials could draw inspiration from how water facilitates, rather than diminishes, cribellate silk adhesion.},

abstract = {Locating and manipulating nano-sized objects to drive motion is a time and effort consuming task. Recent advances show that it is possible to generate motion without direct intervention, by embedding the source of motion in the system configuration. In this work, an alternative manner to controllably displace nano-objects without external manipulation is demonstrated, by employing spiral-shaped carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene nanoribbon structures (GNR). The spiral shape contains smooth gradients of curvature, which lead to smooth gradients of bending energy. It is shown that these gradients as well as surface energy gradients can drive nano-oscillators. An energy analysis is also carried out by approximating the carbon nanotube to a thin rod and how torsional gradients can be used to drive motion is discussed. For the nanoribbons, the role of layer orientation is also analyzed. The results show that motion is not sustainable for commensurate orientations, in which AB stacking occurs. For incommensurate orientations, friction almost vanishes, and in this instance, the motion can continue even if the driving forces are not very high. This suggests that mild curvature gradients, which can already be found in existing nanostructures, could provide mechanical stimuli to direct motion.},

abstract = {Controllable rapid expansion and activation of gases is important for a variety of applications, including combustion engines, thrusters, actuators, catalysis, and sensors. Typically, the activation of macroscopic gas volumes is based on ultra-fast chemical reactions, which require fuel and are irreversible. An “electrically powered explosion”, i.e., the rapid increase in temperature of a macroscopic relevant gas volume induced by an electrical power pulse, is a feasible repeatable and clean alternative, providing adaptable non-chemical power on demand. Till now, the fundamental problem was to find an efficient transducer material that converts electrical energy into an immediate temperature increase of a sufficient gas volume. To overcome these limitations, we developed electrically powered repeatable air explosions (EPRAE) based on free-standing graphene layers of nanoscale thickness in the form of microtubes that are interconnected to a macroscopic framework. These low-density and highly permeable graphene foams are characterized by heat capacities comparable to air. The EPRAE process facilitates cyclic heating of cm3-sized air volumes to several 100 °C for more than 100,000 cycles, heating rates beyond 300,000 K s−1 and repetition rates of several Hz. It enables pneumatic actuators with the highest observed output power densities (>40 kW kg−1) and strains ∼100%, as well as tunable microfluidic pumps, gas flowmeters, thermophones, and micro-thrusters.},

abstract = {Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a glassy engineering polymer that finds extensive use in a number of applications. Over the past decade, thin films of PMMA were combined with graphene or other two-dimensional materials for applications in the area of nanotechnology. However, the effect of size upon the mechanical behavior of this thermoplastic polymer has not been fully examined. In this work, we adopted a homemade nanomechanical device to assess the yielding and fracture characteristics of freestanding, ultrathin (180-280 nm) PMMA films of a loaded area as large as 0.3 mm2. The measured values of Young's modulus and yield strength were found to be broadly similar to those measured in the bulk, but in contrast, all specimens exhibited a quite surprisingly high strain at failure (>20%). Detailed optical examination of the specimens during tensile loading showed clear evidence of craze development which however did not lead to premature fracture. This work may pave the way for the development of glassy thermoplastic films with high ductility at ambient temperatures.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials made of cerium oxides CeO2and Ce2O3have a broad range of applications, from catalysts in automotive, industrial or energy operations to promising materials to enhance hadrontherapy effectiveness in oncological treatments. To elucidate the physico-chemical mechanisms involved in these processes, it is of paramount importance to know the electronic excitation spectra of these oxides, which are obtained here through high-accuracy linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations. In particular, the macroscopic dielectric response functionsof both bulk CeO2and Ce2O3are derived, which compare remarkably well with the available experimental data. These results stress the importance of appropriately accounting for local field effects to model the dielectric function of metal oxides. Furthermore, we reckon the energy loss functions Im(−1/) of the materials, including the accurate evaluation of the momentum transfer dispersion from first-principles calculations. In this respect, by using Mermin-type parametrization we are able to model the contribution of different electronic excitations to the dielectric loss function. Finally, from the knowledge of the electron inelastic mean free path, together with the elastic mean free path provided by the relativistic Mott theory, we carry out statistical Monte Carlo (MC) electron transport simulations to reproduce the major features of the reported experimental reflection electron energy loss (REEL) spectra of cerium oxides. The good agreement with REEL experimental data strongly supports our approach based on MC modelling, whose main inputs were obtained usingab initiocalculated electronic excitation spectra in a broad range of momentum and energy transfers.},

abstract = {The spiders of Theridiidae's family display a peculiar behaviour when they hunt extremely large prey. They lift the quarry, making it unable to escape, by attaching pre-tensioned silk threads to it. In this work, we analysed for the first time in the laboratory the lifting hunting mechanism and, in order to quantify the phenomenon, we applied the lifting mechanics theory. The comparison between the experiments and the theory suggests that, during the process, spiders do not stretch the silk too much by keeping it in the linear elastic regime. We thus report here further evidence for the strong role of silk in spiders' evolution, especially how spiders can stretch and use it as an external tool to overcome their muscles' limits and capture prey with large mass, e.g. 50 times the spider's mass.},

abstract = {The progressive falling of barriers among disciplines is opening unforeseen scenarios in diagnosis and treatment of cancer diseases. By sharing models and mature knowledge in physics, engineering, computer sciences and molecular biology, synergistic efforts have in fact contributed in the last years to re-think still unsolved problems, shedding light on key roles of mechanobiology in tumors and envisaging new effective strategies for a precise medicine. The use of ultrasounds for altering cancer cells' program is one of the most attracting grounds to be explored in oncophysics, although how to administer mechanical energy to impair selected cell structures and functions simultaneously overcoming the critical trade-off between the impact of the cure and the patient risk still remains an open issue. Within this framework, by starting from the theoretical possibility of selectively attacking malignant cells by exploiting the stiffness discrepancies between tumor and healthy single cells, first proposed by Fraldi et al. (2015), we here investigate the in-frequency response of an overall spherical close-packing of geometrically equal polyhedral cells to gain insights into how mechanical resonance and vibration-induced failure phenomena can be oriented to destroy specific target units when both the cell populations coexist, as it happens for in vivo cases. Inspired by the dynamic action of earthquakes – which fracture only selected elements among adjacent ones in the same structure or damage individual constructions in contiguous buildings – we study the harmonic response of hierarchically architectured cell agglomerates, inhabited by both tumor and healthy cells that interact mutually throughout the extra-cellular matrix and whose cytoskeleton is modeled as a nonlinear soft-tensegrity structure. Numerical Finite Element results show that, at frequencies compatible with low intensity therapeutic ultrasounds, mechanical resonance and possible fatigue cycles of the pre-stressed actin filaments and microtubules can be selectively induced in cancer cells as a function of the global volume fraction of the cell species, paving the way for future engineered treatment protocols.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the phenomenon of coalescence-induced droplet jumping has been studied in depth because of the advantages it brings in applications such as anti-frosting, anti-icing, condensation heat transfer, water harvesting, thermal diodes for electronics cooling and self-cleaning [1]. In this work we theoretically and experimentally show that surfaces structured with micro truncated cones covered with highly hydrophobic nanostructures exhibit a recurrent self-ejection of single condensate droplets in addition to the common coalescence-induced jumps. We analytically modelled the external forces acting both on a droplet of condensate slowly growing in conical pores (a simplification of the growth between truncated cones) and during the following rapid transient for two possible cases of self-ejection: 1) rapid swelling out of the structures and 2) detachment from a pinning site (a less hydrophobic defect or the nucleation site). Viscous and adhesion dissipations were included in the modelling. We described the shape of the growing droplet as a function of the tapering (B) and of dynamic contact angles (vadv and vrec ). For both cases, the minimum requirement for self-ejection is that the receding angle of the walls (vrec ) and any pinning site (vpinningrec ) are greater than 90°+B. In the first case, as the volume increases, the upper meniscus moves towards the apex of the cones and the lower one follows it as soon as it reaches vrec; when the droplet reaches the apex of the structures it self-ejects because the superior meniscus expands rapidly and a Laplace pressure gradient is generated between the menisci. In the second case, the superior meniscus grows towards the apex and when the lower one recedes from the pinning site, the droplet self-ejects due to the Laplace pressure gradient generated by the abrupt change in wettability, as recently reported for relatively large droplets (radius > 50 $\mu$m) in diverging grooves [2]. Describing growth and self-ejection with a system of forces requires a careful distinction between external and internal forces. The modelling with forces, unlike the energetic one [2], allowed us to describe the ejection transient dynamics and to derive the ejection velocity while maintaining the dependence on the dynamic contact angles of the superhydrophobic walls and of an eventual pinning site, fundamental quantities for the design of real surfaces. The analytical results relative to the case of the pinning site foresee that, at a fixed contact angle hysteresis of the superhydrophobic walls and vpinningrec, the ejection velocity increases with B (until the limit B = vpinningrec − 90°, beyond which there cannot be ejection); in addition, the velocity is greater as the droplet size decreases if viscous dissipations are not considered while a peak trend is observed with the dissipations included. We fabricated silicon truncated micro cones arranged in square and hexagonal patterns and covered with nanostructures. Through condensation experiments in a controlled environmental chamber we observed for the first time the self-ejection of the drops that nucleate and grow between the cones (in the case in question the droplet diameter ≈ 11 um). By fabricating cones of different sizes, we have also studied the self-ejection rate per unit area as a function of the droplet size. Furthermore, we performed preliminary condensation frosting experiments. Future investigations of this new class of jumping droplet surfaces may show important advantages in the mentioned applications.},

abstract = {Large scale elastic metamaterials have recently attracted increasing interest in the scientific community for their potential as passive isolation structures for seismic waves. In particular, so-called "seismic shields"have been proposed for the protection of large areas where other isolation strategies (e.g. dampers) are not workable solutions. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of an innovative design based on hierarchical design of the unit cell, i.e. a structure with a self-similar geometry repeated at different scales. Results show how the introduction of hierarchy allows the conception of unit cells exhibiting reduced size with respect to the wavelength while maintaining the same or improved isolation efficiency at frequencies of interest for earthquake engineering. This allows to move closer to the practical realization of such seismic shields, where low-frequency operation and acceptable size are both essential characteristics for feasibility.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of artificial spider silks are approaching a stage where commercial applications become realistic. However, the yields of recombinant silk proteins that can be used to produce fibers with good mechanical properties are typically very low and many purification and spinning protocols still require the use of urea, hexafluoroisopropanol, and/or methanol. Thus, improved production and spinning methods with a minimal environmental impact are needed. We have previously developed a miniature spider silk protein that is characterized by high solubility in aqueous buffers and spinnability in biomimetic set-ups. In this study, we developed a production protocol that resulted in an expression level of >20 g target protein per liter in an Escherichia coli fed-batch culture, and subsequent purification under native conditions yielded 14.5 g/l. This corresponds to a nearly six-fold increase in expression levels, and a 10-fold increase in yield after purification compared to reports for recombinant spider silk proteins. Biomimetic spinning using only aqueous buffers resulted in fibers with a toughness modulus of 74 MJ/m3, which is the highest reported for biomimetically as-spun artificial silk fibers. Thus, the process described herein represents a milestone for the economic production of biomimetic silk fibers for industrial applications.},

Driven by their wide range of applications, we provide an overview of a class of elastic solids which embed dynamic microstructures capable of trapping energy when subject to dynamic loads. Based on the recently developed modeling approaches, we show several applications related to wave cloaking, filtering and also multi-structured surfaces, often referred to as meta-surfaces. These culminate in the analysis of a practical example, based on a real-life recent seismic event induced by a hydrofracture exploration. The latter shows the viability of the vibration analysis in the assessment of the seismic response, and also the role of meta-surfaces as localisers of vibrations, e.g. suggesting non-periodic earthquake tolerant design strategies of housing estates.},

Specifically, ca. 30% of the individuals did not even attempt to probe the sunflower plants to which the stimulus was transmitted, while the remaining showed a sex-independent reduction in inges-tion of the xylem sap, i.e., P. spumarius' main food source, of ca. 67% compared to the control. Even so, the stimulus did not affect the feeding behavior when transmitted to olive plants. The possible reflection of a signal-based vector behavior disturbance on the epidemiology of X. fastidiosa, together with future research needs are discussed.},

abstract = {The mechanical performance of reinforced composites is strongly influenced at different scales by the stress transferred at the matrix-fibre interfaces and at any surface where material discontinuity occurs. In particular, the mechanical response of elastomeric composites where the reinforcement is composed by cords with helically wound fibres is heavily compromised by fatigue and delamination phenomena occurring at cord-rubber as well as at the ply interfaces, since rubber and polymeric matrices are mainly vulnerable to the accumulation of deviatoric energy due to the shear stresses transferred across the surfaces. Despite the large diffusion of composites in a vast field of applications and the mature knowledge of their behaviour, some key mechanical aspects underlying failure mechanisms are still partially unclear. For example, stress amplification and strain localization are often difficult to predict by means of analytical solutions and averaging techniques that usually conceal stress gradients. In this work, we analyse coupling between torsional and tensile loads in twisted cords, which are adopted in many cases to reinforce composites and rubbers in tire applications. We provide a model characterized by an enriched cord-matrix mechanical interplay able to theoretically explain and predict actual stress distributions responsible for the onset of delamination and fatigue-guided phenomena that are experimentally observed in these composites. In particular, we demonstrate that the assumption of a monoclinic/trigonal behaviour for the mechanical response of the hierarchical strands allows to estimate, by means of analytical formulas and a homogenization approach, hitherto neglected shear stresses at the matrix-reinforcement interface. These stresses are transferred to the neighbouring regions, leading to post-elastic behaviour and failure events. Finite Element simulation results for rubber/cord composites under various boundary conditions highlight the discrepancies in mechanical behaviour between the proposed model and standard approaches in the literature, while experimental tests performed on composite rubber pads confirm theoretical predictions, providing qualitative evidence of the onset of cracks.},

abstract = {Summary. The present work aims to investigate the mechanical properties of the cellular structure based on the Isotruss unit cell by implementing the finite element method (FEM) introducing a representative elementary volume (REV). As an orthotropic cellular structure, the three principal Young's modulus along the longitudinal and transversal directions are evaluated. The influence of the geometrical parameters on the elastic properties is studied in detail. Results reveal that Young's modulus in two transverse directions are almost close, showing a 12% difference. Besides, the proposed unit cell presents the ability to tune the elasticity along with the main directions. It is seen that increasing the angle of helical pitch, increases the longitudinal Young's modulus while decreases the transverse ones that suggest a considerable possibility for optimal designs. As an example, mimicking Young's modulus of the human cortical bone as an orthotropic material is explored and it is seen that the presented cellular structure based on the Isotruss unit cell can successfully fit.},

abstract = {Kesterite (CZTS, Cu2ZnSnS4) is a quaternary chalcogenide which structural complexity leads to polymorphism and numerous kinds of disorder in cation sites, with interesting effects on thermoelectric properties. Tetragonal kesterite faces an order-disorder phase transition from I-4 to I-42m crystal structures around 533 K, which causes a sharp increase in the Seebeck coefficient. The degree of order in the crystal structure determines the entity of this enhancement, locally influencing the steepness of the trend of thermopower in the transition region. The presence of secondary phases reduces the effect of the transition as well as causing a progressive reduction of the Seebeck coefficient. The present results show that a measurement of Seebeck coefficient provides direct and distinctive information on the degree of order and phase purity of kesterite samples, integrating results of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.},

abstract = {Materials that are lightweight yet exhibit superior mechanical properties are of compelling importance for several technological applications that range from aircrafts to household appliances. Lightweight materials allow energy saving and reduce the amount of resources required for manufacturing. Researchers have expended significant efforts in the quest for such materials, which require new concepts in both tailoring material microstructure as well as structural design. Architectured materials, which take advantage of new engineering paradigms, have recently emerged as an exciting avenue to create bespoke combinations of desired macroscopic material responses. In some instances, rather unique structures have emerged from advanced geometrical concepts (e.g. gyroids, menger cubes, or origami/kirigami-based structures), while in others innovation has emerged from mimicking nature in bio-inspired materials (e.g. honeycomb structures, nacre, fish scales etc.). Beyond design, additive manufacturing has enabled the facile fabrication of complex geometrical and bio-inspired architectures, using computer aided design models. The combination of simulations and experiments on these structures has led to an enhancement of mechanical properties, including strength, stiffness and toughness. In this review, we provide a perspective on topologically engineered architectured materials that exhibit optimal mechanical behaviour and can be readily printed using additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Water and humidity severely affect the material properties of spider major ampullate silk, causing the fiber to become plasticized, contract, swell and undergo torsion. Several amino acid residue types have been proposed to be involved in this process, but the complex composition of the native fiber complicates detailed investigations. Here, we observe supercontraction in biomimetically produced artificial spider silk fibers composed of defined proteins. We found experimental evidence that proline is not the sole residue responsible for supercontraction and that tyrosine residues in the amorphous regions of the silk fiber play an important role. Furthermore, we show that the response of artificial silk fibers to humidity can be tuned, which is important for the development of materials for applications in wet environments, eg producing water resistant fibers with maximal strain at break and toughness modulus.},

Indeed, creating a soft "bionicomposite"with enhanced mechanical and/or other multifunctional properties, e.g., electric, magnetic, etc., is attractive for material science. Pugno and co-workers were the first to expose spiders to carbon-based nanomaterials, reporting promising results in terms of silk maximal reinforcements. In a subsequent paper, Kelly and co-workers used a different approach and did not obtain any significant strengthening in the silk. These different results highlight the importance of exploring the issue better. In this work, spiders were exposed to nanomaterial solutions with different protocols, and the properties of their silk were monitored for 14 days, displaying a strong protocol influence and inherent day-to-day variability (up to 300% of a single property). This made this paper's results aligned with both the previous mentioned works, pinpointing the key challenge to merging silk and nanomaterials using spiders. This work should stimulate further studies and discussion on the topic.},

abstract = {Electronics and soft robotics demand the development of a new generation of hybrid materials featuring novel properties. Among these, remarkable mechanical properties are required to sustain mechanical stresses, and electrical and magnetic properties are essential to design the devices' interface. In this study, a hybrid material is presented, consisting of a spider silk thread, providing mechanical robustness, coated with a layer of a magnetostrictive FeCo alloy, which ensures both electrical conductivity and stress-sensitive magnetic properties. The durability and the homogeneity of the composite are validated, as well as its ability to respond to magnetic and mechanical stimuli. Despite the coating, the soft nature of the silk and its mechanical performances are preserved. The magnetic study reveals that the magnetic behavior of the film is strongly affected by the silk thread–FeCo layer interaction, especially under mechanical stresses. Indeed, when the composite is subjected to tensile strain, the magnetic signal changes accordingly, indicating that the layer–silk interaction is maintained and can be exploited to reveal the tensional state of the sample even under severe cycles. Therefore, the presented hybrid material is a flexible fiber with properties that are suitable for magneto-electronics applications, e.g., magnetic actuators as well as strain/stress sensors.},

abstract = {The contact of two surfaces in relative rotating motion occurs in many practical applications, from mechanical devices to human joints, displaying an intriguing interplay of effects at the onset of sliding due to the axisymmetric stress distribution. Theoretical and numerical models have been developed for some typical configurations, but work remains to be done to understand how to modify the emergent friction properties in this configuration. In this paper, we extend the two-dimensional (2D) spring-block model to investigate friction between surfaces in torsional contact. We investigate how the model describes the behavior of an elastic surface slowly rotating over a rigid substrate, comparing results with analytical calculations based on energy conservation. We show that an appropriate grading of the tribological properties of the surface can be used to avoid a non-uniform transition to sliding due to the axisymmetric configuration.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

Each membrane is spray-coated on either side with carbon black-silicone stretchable electrodes, forming four independent radial actuation segments. The two conical membranes support a central end effector. Via image processing-based motion tracking, we show how, by modulating the electrical activation of the actuation segments, the end effector can be finely positioned with multiple degrees of freedom. The direction and the amplitude/speed of motion of a central dot are tuned via a custom-made, Arduino microcontroller-driven, multichannel, high-voltage control unit. Different trajectories forming geometrical shapes (such as figure of star, cross and circle) are shown, demonstrating the possibility of mixing fluids in a chamber on the end effector plane, according to different mixing patterns. The paper discusses the effect on the mixing performance of key material-related parameters, such as the film thickness, the resistivity of the electrodes, the prestrain of the membranes, as well as the elastomer's dielectric permittivity and elastic modulus.},

In particular, fangs, legs, and prosoma are the main rigid structures of the exoskeleton and their properties must be measured to better understand their mechanical behaviours. Here we investigate, by means of nanoindentation, the mechanical properties of the external sclerotized cuticles of such parts in the spider Harpactira curvipes. Interestingly, the results show that the leg's cuticle is stiffer than the prosoma and has a stiffness similar to the one of the tip fangs. This could be explained by the legs' function in perceiving vibrations that could be facilitated by higher stiffness. From a broader perspective, this characterization could help to understand how the same basic material (the cuticle, i.e. mainly composed of chitin) can be tuned to achieve different mechanical functions, which improves the animal's adaptation to specific evolutive requirements. We, thus, hope that this work stimulates further comparative analysis. Moreover, these results may also be potentially important to inspire the design of graded materials with superior mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Artificial spider silk has emerged as a biobased fiber that could replace some petroleum-based materials that are on the market today. Recent progress made it possible to produce the recombinant spider silk protein NT2RepCT at levels that would make the commercialization of fibers spun from this protein economically feasible. However, for most applications, the mechanical properties of the artificial silk fibers need to be improved. This could potentially be achieved by redesigning the spidroin, and/or by changing spinning conditions. Here, we show that several spinning parameters have a significant impact on the fibers' mechanical properties by tensile testing more than 1000 fibers produced under 92 different conditions. The most important factors that contribute to increasing the tensile strength are fast reeling speeds and/or employing post-spin stretching. Stretching in combination with optimized spinning conditions results in fibers with a strength of >250 MPa, which is the highest reported value for fibers spun using natively folded recombinant spidroins that polymerize in response to shear forces and lowered pH.},

abstract = {Background: Recently, in the field of abdominal wall repair surgery, some minimally invasive procedures introduced the use of staplers to provide a retromuscular prosthetic repair. However, to the knowledge of the authors, there are little data in the literature about the outcomes of stapled sutures adoption for midline reconstruction. This study aims to investigate the biomechanics of stapled sutures, simple (stapled), or oversewn (hybrid), in comparison with handsewn suture. From the results obtained, we tried to draw indications for their use in a clinical context. Methods: Human cadaver fascia lata specimens, sutured (handsewn, stapled, or hybrid) or not, underwent tensile tests. The data on strength (maximal stress), ultimate strain (deformability), Young's modulus (rigidity), and dissipated specific energy (ability to absorb mechanical energy up to the breaking point) were recorded for each type of specimens and analyzed. Results: Stapled and hybrid suture showed a significantly higher strength (handsewn 0.83 MPa, stapled 2.10 MPa, hybrid 2.68 MPa) and a trend toward a lower ultimate strain as compared to manual sutures (handsewn 344%, stapled 249%, hybrid 280%). Stapled and hybrid sutures had fourfold higher Young's modulus as compared to handsewn sutures (handsewn 1.779 MPa, stapled 7.374 MPa, hybrid 6.964 MPa). Handsewn and hybrid sutures showed significantly higher dissipated specific energy (handsewn 0.99 mJ-mm3, stapled 0.73 mJ-mm3, hybrid 1.35 mJ-mm3). Conclusion: Stapled sutures can resist high loads, but are less deformable and rigid than handsewn suture. This suggests a safer employment in case of small defects or diastasis (< W1 in accord to EHS classification), where the presumed tissutal displacement is minimal. Oversewing a stapled suture improves its efficiency, becoming crucial in case of larger defects (> W1 in accord to EHS classification) where the expected tissutal displacement is maximal. Hybrid sutures seem to be a good compromise.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing offers a promising, challenging opportunity to manufacture component parts with ad hoc designed composite materials. In this study, the novelty of the research is the production of multiscale composites by means of a solvent-free process based on melt com-pounding of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), with various amounts of microfillers, i.e., milled (M) carbon fibers (CFs) and nanofillers, i.e., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The compounded materials were processed into compression molded sheets and into ex-truded filaments. The latter were then used to print fused filament fabrication (FFF) specimens. The multiscale addition of the microfillers inside the ABS matrix caused a notable increase in rigidity and a slight increase in strength. However, it also brought about a significant reduction of the strain at break. Importantly, GNPs addition had a good impact on the rigidity of the materials, whereas CNTs favored/improved the composites' electrical conductivity. In particular, the addition of this nanofiller was very effective in improving the electrical conductivity compared to pure ABS and micro compos-ites, even with the lowest CNT content. However, the filament extrusion and FFF process led to the creation of voids within the structure, causing a significant loss of mechanical properties and a slight improvement of the electrical conductivity of the printed multiscale composites. Selective parameters have been presented for the comparison and selection of compositions of multiscale nanocomposites.},

abstract = {Within a purely mechanical setting, we investigate the behavior, up to full decohesion, of a system modeling the interactions exchanged between focal adhesions and extra-cellular matrix in the passive regime. In our work, decohesion is described as a homogenized effect of low scales events leading to the rupture of the molecular bonds between integrin receptors and the extra-cellular matrix ligands. We propose a simple three-layers scheme of this mechanical system and, based on a Griffith-like approach, we analytically describe the transition from an elastic regime to the nucleation of a decohesion front, up to full decohesion. We focus our attention on the important role played by elasticity and deduce how the relative stiffness of the layers modulates the decohesion behavior, with the system undergoing a ductile–fragile detachment transition. The comparison with known experimental results on focal adhesions and DNA shear denaturation supports the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the mechanical behavior of decohesion phenomena in biological systems. Interestingly, we show the possibility of predicting focal adhesion lengths distribution based on the obtained force saturation as the focal adhesion dimension is increased theoretically deduced.},

abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the elasticity, strength and failure of aluminum (Al) nanocomposites with holey-graphene (hG), which were melted and recrystallized. Five nanocomposites (Al-graphene and four Al-hG - two of them doped, with nitrogen and boron) were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. They were melted and subsequently recrystallized at a fixed cooling rate of 0.25 K/ps. The nucleation temperature of nanocomposites was increased by 300–200 K compared to pure aluminum. The Al crystallization in the nanocomposites was about 85 % (97 % for pure Al). The nanocomposites with undoped nanofillers showed an increase in Young's modulus between 15 and 27 % relative to pure Al, while doped nanofillers showed no improvement. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites depended on the characteristics of the nanofillers, namely (i) the porosity, (ii) the percentage of recrystallization of the Al matrix, and (iii) the interfacial adhesion in the interface Al-nanofillers. The results show that undoped nanofillers have much higher Young's modulus and lower porosity compared to the doped nanofillers (N-hG and B-hG). Finally, the application of the inverse rule of mixtures to extract the Young's modulus of the nanocomposite was successful.},

abstract = {Silk fibres attract great interest in materials science for their biological and mechanical properties. Hitherto, the mechanical properties of the silk fibres have been explored mainly by tensile tests, which provide information on their strength, Young's modulus, strain at break and toughness modulus. Several hypotheses have been based on these data, but the intrinsic and often overlooked variability of natural and artificial silk fibres makes it challenging to identify trends and correlations. In this work, we determined the mechanical properties of Bombyx mori cocoon and degummed silk, native spider silk, and artificial spider silk, and compared them with classical commercial carbon fibres using large sample sizes (from 10 to 100 fibres, in total 200 specimens per fibre type). The results confirm a substantial variability of the mechanical properties of silk fibres compared to commercial carbon fibres, as the relative standard deviation for strength and strain at break is 10–50%. Moreover, the variability does not decrease significantly when the number of tested fibres is increased, which was surprising considering the low variability frequently reported for silk fibres in the literature. Based on this, we prove that tensile testing of 10 fibres per type is representative of a silk fibre population. Finally, we show that the ideal shape of the stress–strain curve for spider silk, characterized by a pronounced exponential stiffening regime, occurs in only 25% of all tested spider silk fibres.},

abstract = {Phononic crystals (PCs) are periodic structures obtained by the spatial arrangement of materials with contrasting properties, which can be designed to efficiently manipulate mechanical waves. Plate structures can be modeled using the Mindlin–Reissner plate theory and have been extensively used to analyze the dispersion relations of PCs. Although the analysis of the propagating characteristics of PCs may be sufficient for simple elastic structures, analyzing the evanescent wave behavior becomes fundamental if the PC contains viscoelastic components. Another complication is that increasingly intricate material distributions in the unit cell of PCs with hierarchical configuration may render the calculation of the complex band structure (i.e., considering both propagating and evanescent waves) prohibitive due to excessive computational workload. In this work, we propose a new extended plane wave expansion formulation to compute the complex band structure of thick PC plates with arbitrary material distribution using the Mindlin–Reissner plate theory containing constituents with a viscoelastic behavior approximated by a Kelvin–Voigt model. We apply the method to investigate the evanescent behavior of periodic hierarchically structured plates for either (i) a hard purely elastic matrix with soft viscoelastic inclusions or (ii) a soft viscoelastic matrix with hard purely elastic inclusions. Our results show that for (i), an increase in the hierarchical order leads to a weight reduction with relatively preserved attenuation characteristics, including attenuation peaks due to locally resonant modes that present a decrease in attenuation upon increasing viscosity levels. For (ii), changing the hierarchical order implies in opening band gaps in distinct frequency ranges, with an overall attenuation improved by an increase in the viscosity levels.},

abstract = {In liquid-based material processing, hydrodynamic forces are known to produce severe bending deformations of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. The non-linear rotational and deformation dynamics of these atomically thin sheets is extremely sensitive to hydrodynamic particle-particle interactions. To investigate this problem, we developed a computational model of the flow dynamics of elastic sheets suspended in a linear shear flow, solving the full fluid-solid coupling problem in the two-dimensional, slender-body, Stokes flow regime. Both single and pairs of sheets in close proximity are analyzed. Despite the model being two-dimensional, the critical non-dimensional shear rate yielding single-particle buckling is comparable in order of magnitude to that reported for fully three-dimensional, disk-like sheets. For pairs of interacting sheets, hydrodynamic interactions lead either to parallel sliding or bending, depending on the value of an elasto-viscous number based on particle length. For sufficiently low bending rigidity or large shear rates, large deformations of initially stacked sheets lead to sheet reattachment after separation, unlike for the rigid case. A peeling-like dynamics where lubrication provides a viscous bonding force is observed for sheet pairs when one of the two sheets is more rigid than the other. Practical implications for graphene processing and exfoliation are discussed.},

abstract = {Cactaceae have adapted to harsh environments by resisting intense solar radiation, retaining and collecting water. Some cacti species have hairs on them along with distinctive spines to serve different functions. In this study, we characterized the Old Man of Andes cactus (Oreocereus trolli). We examined the surface morphology and estimated roughness and adhesion force of both spines and hairs. They both consist of longitudinal microgrooves. The condensation experiments carried out on spines showed that there is a particular phenomenon of distant coalescence (DC): smaller droplets flow totally or partially into larger ones through the microgrooves with consequent accumulation of water in a few large drops. An earlier study (Bintein et al., 2019) has shown that artificial micro-grooved surfaces that exhibit DC are more efficient than flat ones at collecting and sliding dew, and thus cactus spines could act as soil dew conveyors. The agreement between our analytical model and experimental data verifies that the flow is driven by the Laplace pressure difference between the drops. This allowed us to obtain a general criterion for predicting the total or partial emptying of the smaller drops as a function of the dynamic contact angles of a surface. With the Wilhelmy method, we determined that hairs are less hydrophilic than spines. We also estimated the mechanical properties of both the spines and hairs to evaluate their possible role in physical defense. This study aids in better understanding the physical attributes and the condensation interaction with microstructures, and suggests some functional roles.},

In this work, a numerical model based on nonlinear stress–strain constitutive relations for spider silk is introduced to investigate how the spider orb web allows spiders to detect and localize prey impacts. The obtained results indicate how the orb web center relative transverse displacements, produced by local resonance mechanisms, are used for precise localization, while nonlinear stress stiffening effects improve prey sensing.

Based on a multiscale self-similar reconstruction, we end-up with a theoretical optimal fractal limit system whose cross section resembles the classical Sierpi{\'{n}}ski triangle. Our optimal construction is finally completed by considering the possibility of a complete plane tessellation. The direct comparison of the dissipation per unit volume $\delta$ with the material dissipation up to the elastic limit $\delta$el shows a great advantage: $\delta$∼2000$\delta$el. Such result is already attained for a realistic case of three only scales of refinement leading almost (96%) the same dissipation of the fractal limit. We also show the possibility of easy recovering of the original configuration after dissipation and we believe that our schematic system can have interesting reliable applications in different technological fields. Interestingly, our multiscale dissipative mechanism is reminiscent of similar strategies observed in nature as a result of bioadaptation such as in the archetypical cases of bone, nacre and spider silk. Even though other phenomena such as inelastic behavior and full tridimensional optimization are surely important in such biological systems, we believe that the suggested dissipation mechanism and scale invariance properties can give insight also in the hierarchical structures observed in important biological examples.},

abstract = {The integration of 2D-graphitic carbon (G) with 1D-carbon nanofiber (CF) allows for the unique properties of 2D graphitic carbon to be combined with the low densities, mechanical performance, and high surface area required for applications across the energy and sustainability landscape. Through a combination of experiments and numerical modeling, we demonstrate the transformation of standard egg-white (EW) proteins into an ultralightweight G-CF aerogel with a multiscale structure. The resulting covalently-bonded hierarchical structure, derived from the complex underlying protein configuration, exhibits a density that is two orders of magnitude lower than existing state-of-the-art materials. We apply this material to the challenges of desalination and water purification, notably demonstrating that the G-CF aerogel significantly improves upon existing materials, capturing 98.2% of ionic impurities and 99.9% of nano/microplastic contamination from seawater.},

abstract = {We describe benchmark experiments to evaluate the frictional properties of laser patterned low-density polyethylene as a function of sliding velocity, normal force, and humidity. The pattern is a square lattice of square cavities with sub-mm spacing. We find that dynamic friction decreases compared to nonpatterned surfaces, since stress concentrations lead to early detachment, and that stick-slip behavior is also affected. Friction increases with humidity, and the onset of stick-slip events occurs in the high humidity regime. Experimental results are compared with numerical simulations of a simplified 2D spring-block model. A good qualitative agreement can be obtained by introducing a deviation from the linear behavior of the Amontons-Coulomb law with the load due to a saturation in the effective contact area with pressure. This also leads to the improvement of the quantitative results of the spring-block model by reducing the discrepancy with the experimental results, indicating the robustness of the adopted simplified approach, which could be adopted to design patterned surfaces with controlled friction properties.},

abstract = {The increasing demand for safe and sustainably produced food is leading to the development of strategies of pest control alternative to chemicals. One innovative method is Vibrational Mating Disruption (VMD) to disrupt insect communication in plants. VMD was proven effective in preventing mating of the grapevine pest Scaphoideus titanus, vector of flavescence dor{\'{e}}e. However, the stress induced by VMD on the target species has the potential to influence other crucial aspects of the insect biology and ethology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to understand side effects of VMD on the flight activity and oviposition of S. titanus. The results of our experiments conducted in the greenhouse showed that in the presence of a receptive female, males fly more if exposed to vibrations than in the silent control but not differently from singles males in silence. Surprisingly, we found that also females subjected to VMD fly more than in the silence. Regarding oviposition, we found that mated females exposed to vibrations and single females (unmated) laid significantly fewer eggs than mated females in silence. In conclusion, this study shows the potential of VMD to interfere, besides with mating, with other important biological aspects of the pest species.},

abstract = {Nature has engineered complex designs to achieve advanced properties and functionalities through millions of years of evolution. Many organisms have adapted to their living environments by producing extremely efficient materials and structures exhibiting optimized mechanical, thermal, and optical properties, which current technology is often unable to reproduce. These properties are often achieved using hierarchical structures spanning macro-, meso-, micro-, and nanoscales, widely observed in many natural materials like wood, bone, spider silk, and sponges. Thus far, bioinspired approaches have been successful in identifying optimized structures in terms of quasistatic mechanical properties, such as strength, toughness, and adhesion, but comparatively little work has been done as far as dynamic ones are concerned (e.g., vibration damping, noise insulation, sound amplification). In particular, relatively limited knowledge currently exists on how hierarchical structure can play a role in the optimization of natural structures, although concurrent length scales no doubt allow multiple frequency ranges to be addressed. Here, we review the main work that has been done to analyze structural optimization for dynamic mechanical properties, highlighting some common traits and strategies in different biological systems. We also discuss the relevance to bioinspired materials, in particular in the field of phononic crystals and metamaterials, and the potential of exploiting natural designs for technological applications.},

abstract = {The design of structures that can yield efficient sound insulation performance is a recurring topic in the acoustic engineering field. Special attention is given to panels, which can be designed using several approaches to achieve considerable sound attenuation. Previously, we have presented the concept of thickness-varying periodic plates with optimized profiles to inhibit flexural wave energy propagation. In this work, motivated by biological structures that present multiple locally resonant elements able to cause acoustic cloaking, we extend our shape optimization approach to design panels that achieve improved acoustic insulation performance using either thickness-varying profiles or locally resonant attachments. The optimization is performed using numerical models that combine the Kirchhoff plate theory and the plane wave expansion method. Our results indicate that panels based on locally resonant mechanisms have the advantage of being robust against variation in the incidence angle of acoustic excitation and, therefore, are preferred for single-leaf applications.

abstract = {Understanding the interplay between concurrent length scales is a fundamental issue in many problems involving friction between sliding interfaces, from tribology to the study of earthquakes and seismic faults. On the one hand, a macroscopic sliding event is preceded by slip precursors with a characteristic propagation length scale. On the other hand, the emergent frictional properties can be modified by surface patterning depending on their geometric length scale. This suggests that macroscopic sliding of structured surfaces is governed by the interplay between the length scale of the slip precursors and those characterizing the geometric features. In this paper, we investigate these aspects by means of numerical simulations using a two-dimensional spring-block model. We discuss the influence of the geometric features on the occurrence and localization of slip precursors, extending the study to interfaces characterized by two geometric length scales. We find that different types of detachment sequences are triggered by specific surface structures, depending on their scales and relation to sliding direction, leading to a macroscopically smooth transition to sliding in the case of hierarchical and/or anisotropic features. These concepts could be exploited in devices switching from static to dynamic sliding, and can contribute to an improvement in the understanding and interpretation of seismic data.},

abstract = {A single-crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon-like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath the graphene are along the <110> and <211> directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single-layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into alternating patterns. A “joint” (an AB-stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few-layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD-grown single-crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70 GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD-grown single-crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.},

In this work, we describe the mechanical stability and tribological behaviour of such coating, comparing it to a DLC-coated bare PEEK. The GO functionalisation of PEEK is realised from a water solution, whereas the DLC coatings are obtained through plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, using various combinations of different precursor gases. We employ atomic force microscopy to investigate the morphology and interfacial adhesion characteristics of the materials. Then, the scratch coefficient of friction of the samples is measured under both constant-load and progressive-load conditions, also in combination with acoustic emission signals.

abstract = {Silk fibers derived from the cocoon of silk moths and the wide range of silks produced by spiders exhibit an array of features, such as extraordinary tensile strength, elasticity, and adhesive properties. The functional features and mechanical properties can be derived from the structural composition and organization of the silk fibers. Artificial recombinant protein fibers based on engineered spider silk proteins have been successfully made previously and represent a promising way towards the large-scale production of fibers with predesigned features. However, for the production and use of protein fibers, there is a need for reliable objective quality control procedures that could be automated and that do not destroy the fibers in the process. Furthermore, there is still a lack of understanding the specifics of how the structural composition and organization relate to the ultimate function of silk-like fibers. In this study, we develop a new method for the categorization of protein fibers that enabled a highly accurate prediction of fiber tensile strength. Based on the use of a common light microscope equipped with polarizers together with image analysis for the precise determination of fiber morphology and optical properties, this represents an easy-to-use, objective non-destructive quality control process for protein fiber manufacturing and provides further insights into the link between the supramolecular organization and mechanical functionality of protein fibers.},

abstract = {In applied biotremology, vibrational signals or cues are exploited to manipulate the target species behaviour. To develop an efficient pest control strategy, other than a detailed investigation into the pest biology and behaviour, the role of the substrate used to transmit the signal is an important feature to be considered, since it may affect vibrations spreading and effective signal transmission and perception. Therefore, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to develop a control technique against the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum. First, an ad hoc vibrational disruptive noise has been developed, based on the acquired knowledge about the mating behaviour and vibrational communication of the mated species. Subsequently, we employed finite-element models to investigate a growing tomato plant response to the aforesaid noise. Modelling how vibrations spread along the plant allowed us to set up a greenhouse experiment to assess the efficacy in terms of insect population of the vibrational treatment, which was administrated through vibrational plates.

abstract = {An analytical model is developed to study the ballistic behavior of multilayer composite armors subjected to the high-velocity impact of projectiles with arbitrary angle of incidence, shape, size, and frictional characteristics. The thickness compaction resulting from the production process is also accounted for, quantifying the role of the curing pressure on the enhancement of the impact toughness of composite laminates. Finite element method simulations are used in a complementary manner to study damage and failure mechanisms within the targets. Both approaches are validated by extensive experimental ballistic tests on multilayer composite targets. The role of the layer stacking sequence is also investigated. It emerges that graded multilayer configurations yield higher toughness when the projectile penetrates plies with decreasing fracture strength. These results can explain common structural arrangements in biological armors as well as be exploited in the design and optimization of shielding structures against high-velocity projectiles.},

abstract = {It has been shown in recent years that many species in Nature employ hierarchy and contact splitting as a strategy to enhance the adhesive properties of their attachments. Maximizing the adhesive force is however not the only goal. Many animals can achieve a tunable adhesive force, which allows them to both strongly attach to a surface and easily detach when necessary. Here, we study the adhesive properties of 3D dendritic attachments, which are structures that are widely occurring in nature and which allow to achieve these goals. These structures exploit branching to provide high variability in the geometry, and thus tunability, and contact splitting, to increase the total peeling line and thus the adhesion force. By applying the same principles presented by A.A. Griffith 100 years ago, we derive an analytical model for the detachment forces as a function of their defining angles in 3D space, finding as limit cases 2D double peeling and 1D single peeling. We also develop a numerical model, including a nonlinear elastic constitutive law, for the validation of analytical calculations, allowing additionally to simulate the entire detachment phase, and discuss how geometrical variations influence the adhesive properties of the structure. Finally, we also realize a proof of concept experiment to further validate theoretical/numerical results. Overall, we show how this generalized attachment structure can achieve large variations in its adhesive and mechanical properties, exploiting variations of its geometrical parameters, and thus tunability. The in-depth study of similar basic structural units and their combination can in future lead to a better understanding of the mechanical properties of complex architectures found in Nature.},

abstract = {Magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been widely studied for effective hydrogen storage. However, its bulk desorption temperature (553 K) is deemed too high for practical applications. Besides doping, a strategy to decrease such reaction energy for releasing hydrogen is the use of MgH2-based nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we investigate first the thermodynamic properties of MgnH2n NPs (n < 10) from first-principles, in particular by assessing the anharmonic effects on the enthalpy, entropy and thermal expansion by means of the stochastic self consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA). This method goes beyond previous approaches, typically based on molecular mechanics and the quasi-harmonic approximation, allowing the ab initio calculation of the fully-anharmonic free energy. We find an almost linear dependence on temperature of the interatomic bond lengths - with a relative variation of few percent over 300 K - alongside with a bond distance decrease of the Mg-H bonds. In order to increase the size of MgnH2n NPs toward experiments of hydrogen desorption we devise a computationally effective machine learning model trained to accurately determine the forces and total energies (i.e. the potential energy surfaces), integrating the latter with the SSCHA model to fully include the anharmonic effects. We find a significative decrease of the H-desorption temperature for sub-nanometric clusters MgnH2n with n ≤ 10, with a non-negligible, although little effect due to anharmonicities (up to 10%).},

abstract = {We report about a biomaterial in the form of film ∼10 $\mu$m thick, consisting of a silk fibroin matrix with embedded iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles, for prospective applications as bioactive coating in regenerative medicine. Films with different load of magnetic nanoparticles are produced (nanoparticles/silk fibroin nominal ratio = 5, 0.5 and 0 wt%) and the structural, mechanical and magnetic properties are studied. The nanoparticles form aggregates in the silk fibroin matrix and the film stiffness, as tested by nanoindentation, is spatially inhomogeneous, but the protein structure is not altered. In vitro biological tests are carried out on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured on the films up to 21 days, with and without an applied static uniform magnetic field. The sample with the highest nanoparticles/silk fibroin ratio shows the best performance in terms of cell proliferation and adhesion. Moreover, it promotes a faster and better osteogenic differentiation, particularly under magnetic field, as indicated by the gene expression level of typical osteogenic markers. These findings are explained in light of the results of the physical characterization, combined with numerical calculations. It is established that the applied magnetic field triggers a virtuous magneto-mechanical mechanism in which dipolar magnetic forces between the nanoparticle aggregates give rise to a spatial distribution of mechanical stresses in the silk fibroin matrix. The film with the largest nanoparticle load, under cell culture conditions (i.e. in aqueous environment), undergoes matrix deformations large enough to be sensed by the seeded cells as mechanical stimuli favoring the osteogenic differentiation.},

Generating electric potential by moving a droplet of ionic solution over 2D materials is a novel method for rain energy harvesting. This work demonstrates a liquid-solid contact electrification-based 3DP nanogenerator where raindrop passes through the positively charged ultrathin gadolinium telluride (Gd2Te3) sheets. The output efficiency of the nanogenerator is increased to ≈400% by enhancing the surface area of copious 3D-printed porous structures. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high electrical conductivity of (112) surface of Gd2Te3 is due to the p-type charge carriers, which help to generate electricity by interacting with the ionic solution. This work can open up a new avenue to advance scientific research on blue energy harvesting and tackle the energy crisis.},

abstract = {Spider webs are finely tuned multifunctional structures, widely studied for their prey capture functionalities such as impact strength and stickiness. However, they are also sophisticated sensing tools that enable the spider to precisely determine the location of impact and capture the prey before it escapes. In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism for this detection process, based on potential modal analysis capabilities of the spider, using its legs as distinct distributed point sensors. To do this, we consider a numerical model of the web structure, including asymmetry in the design, prestress, and geometrical nonlinearity effects. We show how vibration signals deriving from impacts can be decomposed into web eigenmode components, through which the spider can efficiently trace the source location. Based on this numerical analysis, we discuss the role of the web structure, asymmetry, and prestress in the imaging mechanism, confirming the role of the latter in tuning the web response to achieve an efficient prey detection instrument. The results can be relevant for efficient distributed impact sensing applications.},

abstract = {Halyomorpha halys (St{\aa}l, 1855), the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), is an invasive species that has become a key agricultural pest in its invaded range. Commercial traps available for BMSB monitoring rely on male produced aggregation pheromones as lure, with two possible shortcomings: trap spillover and low detection precision. In this study, we assessed if vibrational signals can increase the attractiveness of pheromone traps by testing the optimized vibration-based lure (Female Song 2, FS2) associated with a specifically designed trap (i.e., the vibrotrap). We evaluated the efficacy of this bimodal trap (i.e., pheromones + vibrations) on females, males and nymphs in controlled conditions (greenhouse) and in the field, in two sites at the margin of two commercial vineyards. In the field, bimodal vibrotraps were compared to three unimodal (i.e., only pheromone) trap types. Both experiments showed that the vibrotrap is highly attractive for BMSB, and the optimized FS2 signal significantly improved its effectiveness. Even though FS2 was selected to target males, the number of trapped females increased as well. Overall, the presented findings show a feasible improvement to future commercial BMSB traps through the synergic use of semiophysicals and semiochemicals. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of vibrotraps for both early detection and mass trapping.},

abstract = {The present report proposes a micromechanics model for predicting the dynamic modulus of rubber blends consisting of a base rubber and devulcanized recycled rubbers reinforced by nanofillers. A four-step hierarchical homogenization is established to relate the properties of components from the nano-sized reinforcements to the macro-scaled final blend. The developed model accounts for the effect of agglomeration and geometry of nano-fillers, the quality of the devulcanization process, and the properties of the interphase surrounding the nanofillers on the dynamic modulus of the rubber blend. A comprehensive dimensionless parametric study is performed whose output in terms of graphical maps can be used as a design guideline for practical cases in industries like automotive. A case study for recycled end-of-life tires (ELTs) reinforced by nano clays is presented and it is found that the nano reinforcement of devulcanized rubbers has a remarkable potential to compensate for the weakness compared to its virgin counterpart.},

abstract = {When humidified at different moisture conditions, restrained spider silk fibers can exhibit a very high supercontraction phenomenon. The hydration water molecules induce a Hydrogen-bonds disruption process that, due to entropic effects, decreases the natural – zero force – end-to-end chains length. By considering a bundle of macromolecules, we describe supercontraction as a possible actuation system and determine the maximum actuation force depending on the silk properties at the molecular scale and on the constraining system representing other silk threads or the actuated device. The comparison with experimental results of Argiope trifasciata silk fibers show the effectiveness of the proposed model in quantitatively predicting the experimental actuation properties. The considered historical case study of obelisk rescue in Saint Peter's Square (Rome) through ropes hydration is discussed evidencing the optimal performances of this natural material adopted as moisture powered actuator: we obtain a work density of 2.19 kJ/m3 making spider silk the most performant hydration driven active material. Moreover we obtain a power density of the order of 730 W/kg about three times the most performant carbon nanotube actuators making such material very competitive as compared with all types of actuators. The analytic description of the macroscopic actuation parameters from microscale properties shows the possibility of adopting our approach also in the field of bioinspired artificial silks design, possibly considering also important non-linear effects in the actuated system.},

abstract = {The cochlea has long been the subject of investigation in various research fields due to its intriguing spiral architecture and unique sensing characteristics. One of its most interesting features is tonotopy, the ability to sense acoustic waves at different spatial locations based on their frequency content. In this work, we propose a novel design for a tonotopic resonator, based on a cochlea-inspired spiral, which can discriminate the frequency content of elastic waves without the use of sub-wavelength resonators. The structure is the result of an optimization process to obtain a uniform distribution of displacement maxima along its centreline for frequencies spanning nearly two-decades, while maintaining a compact design. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the concept and experimental measurements to validate it on a 3D printed structure. The resulting frequency-dependent distribution is also shown to be a viable means to discriminate signals with various frequency components. We also show that for appropriate parameter ranges, the tonotopic behaviour can be inverted, i.e., lower frequencies can be made to concentrate in narrower regions, as happens in the real cochlea. The harnessed tonotopic features can be used as a fundamental principle to design structures with applications in areas such as non-destructive testing and vibration attenuation.},

abstract = {Hierarchy provides unique opportunities for the design of advanced materials with superior properties that arise from architecture, rather than from constitutive material response. Contrary to the quasi-static regime, where the potential of hierarchy has been largely explored, its role in vibration mitigation and wave manipulation remains elusive. So far, the majority of the studies concerning hierarchical elastic metamaterials have proposed a self-similar repetition of a specific unit cell at multiple scale levels, leading to the activation of the same bandgap mechanism at different frequencies. On the contrary, here, we show that by designing non self-similar hierarchical geometries allows us to create periodic structures supporting multiple, highly attenuative and broadband bandgaps involving (independently or simultaneously) different scattering mechanisms, namely, Bragg scattering, local resonance and/or inertial amplification, at different frequencies. The type of band gap mechanism is identified and discussed by examining the vibrational mode shapes and the imaginary component of the wavenumber in the dispersion diagram of the unit cell. We also experimentally confirm this by performing measurements in the lowest frequency regime on a 3D printed structure. Hierarchical design strategies may find application in vibration mitigation for civil, aerospace and mechanical engineering.},

abstract = {The spreading of respiratory diseases through deposited saliva droplets is strongly dependent on the water evaporation process that may determine the virus viability due to the increase in concentration of nonvolatile compounds that are harmful for the virus. The drying time of a virus-laden droplet is influenced by environmental conditions, such as relative humidity and temperature, physical properties, such as the features of the surface on which it is deposited, and the wetting regime. Under this perspective, we addressed the modeling of an evaporating sessile droplet resting on a flat smooth surface, extending a previous diffusion-based model from the same authors. The evaporation behavior of sessile droplets of aqueous sodium chloride solutions and the virus viability of a surrogate virus (MS2) have been simulated considering different wetting regimes to account for different types of surfaces, ranging from highly hydrophilic to highly hydrophobic, as well as different ambient conditions, in terms of temperature and relative humidity. The results of calculations were given in terms of time evolution of contact angle, contact radius, mixture volume, and salt concentration, unveiling the importance of different wetting regimes for evaporation behavior and drying time. Longer evaporation times have been observed as temperature decreases and relative humidity increases. With reference to a surrogate virus, we evaluated the virus viability at different selected conditions, observing the classical U-shape of relative viability as a function of relative humidity of the environment at a certain temperature.},

abstract = {In this work, a novel approach for the topology optimization of phononic crystals based on the replacement of the computationally demanding traditional solvers for the calculation of dispersion diagrams with a surrogate deep learning (DL) model is proposed. We show that our trained DL model is ultrafast in the prediction of the dispersion diagrams, and therefore can be efficiently used in the optimization framework. The main novelty of the proposed approach relies on the use of non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) curves instead of pixels and/or mesh elements to control the shape of the unit cells of phononic crystals. The surrogate DL model is combined with a genetic algorithm serving as a topology optimization tool. The validity of the approach is shown in the case of phononic crystals made of a continuous matrix with cavities. Several objective functions have been tested as an alternative to the most common gap to mid-gap ratio. This allowed us to obtain interesting phononic crystal geometries which can be easily additively manufactured. The proposed method applies to problems involving inverse design and can open new avenues in the design of computer-assisted periodic structures.},

abstract = {One of the oldest yet most common modalities of locomotion known among limbless animals is undulatory, also recognized for its stability compared to legged locomotion. Multiple forms of active mechanisms, e.g. active gait control, and passive mechanisms, e.g. body morphology and material properties, have adapted to different environments. The current research explores the passive role of body stiffness and internal losses in meeting terrain requirements. Furthermore, it addresses the influence of the environment on the resultant gait and how the interplay between various environments and body properties can lead to different speeds. We modelled undulatory locomotion in a dry friction environment where frictional anisotropy determines propulsion. We found that the body stiffness, the moment of inertia, the dry frictional coefficient ratio between normal and tangential frictional constants, and the internal damping of the body play an essential role in optimizing speed and animal adaptability to external conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that various known gaits like swimming, crawling and polychaete-like locomotion are achieved as a result of the interaction between body and environment parameters. Moreover, we validated the model by retrieving a corn snake's speed using data from the literature. This study demonstrates that the dependence between morphology, body material properties and environment can be exploited to design long-segmented robots to perform in specialized situations.},

Coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations plays a particularly valuable role in this endeavor, allowing for the efficient investigation of spider silk's mechanical properties. Our research is centered on the examination of spider silk, which comprises major ampullate silk protein (MaSp1). To achieve this, we developed a CG molecular dynamics model. Our investigation began with a focus on MaSp1 chains subjected to uniaxial tensile load, with comparisons made between the CG model results and all-atom simulations. Subsequently, we extended our simulations to encompass more extensive systems, including fully-ordered MaSp1 bundles undergoing uniaxial static stretching. Through comparison with existing literature, we assess how well the CG model reproduces the mechanical properties of spider silk in highly ordered structures. Furthermore, we explored a scenario where MaSp1 bundles were randomly positioned and stretched, providing valuable insights into silk behavior when the initial structure lacks order. Another simulation involved random positioning, but with some degree of orientation in the loading direction, allowing for a closer examination of the initial structure's influence.},

abstract = {We have designed and tested a device based on non-Newtonian fluids for the attenuation of tangential impacts energy in helmets. A shear thickening fluid based on borurated silicones has given the best results in terms of impact energy attenuation in a system that selectively mimics tangential impacts and for this reason it has been used to fill the chamber of a pad, prepared by additive manufacturing, for impact energy dissipation. The pad is composed of a case containing the fluid in which is immersed a rigid pin that is free to move in all direction and therefore is able to absorb energy during its movement inside the fluid. A motorcycle helmet, already composed of two concentrical expanded polystyrene (EPS) liners, has been implemented with seven pads between the two EPS layers. The two layers have only been connected by means of the dissipating pad and are free to rotate and to dissipate energy during the rotation. The results of oblique impacts according to ECE 22.06 with three impact positions, shows a reduction of the brain injury criterion of 14% for the helmet with the pads, compared to the standard helmet, with values well below the threshold imposed by the norm. On the contrary, the maximum of the peak rotational acceleration show a 3% increase. Nevertheless, the rotational acceleration versus time curves indicates that in all three orientations the time of the maximum is shifted towards longer times for the helmets with the pads, indicating that the pads retard the acceleration of the head due to the efficient rotation of the two EPS parts connected by the pads. The described system could be implemented with minimal modifications in existing protective sport and motorcycle helmets.},

abstract = {The extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) formulation is derived to obtain the complex band structure of flexural waves in viscoelastic thin phononic crystal plates considering the Kirchhoff–Love plate theory. The presented formulation yields the evanescent behavior of flexural waves in periodic thin plates considering viscoelastic effects. The viscosity is modeled by the standard linear solid model (SLSM), typically used to closely model the behavior of polymers. It is observed that the viscoelasticity influences significantly both the propagating and evanescent Bloch modes. The highest wave attenuation of the viscoelastic phononic thin plate is found around a unit cell filling fraction of 0.37 for higher frequencies considering the least attenuated wave mode. This EPWE formulation broadens the suitable methods to handle evanescent flexural waves in 2-D thin periodic plate systems considering the effects of viscoelasticity on wave attenuation.},

abstract = {Combined photothermal-hygroscopic effects enable novel materials actuation strategies based on renewable and sustainable energy sources such as sunlight. Plasmonic nanoparticles have gained considerable interest as photothermal agents, however, the employment in sunlight-driven photothermal-hygroscopic actuators is still bounded, mainly due to the limited absorbance once integrated into nanocomposite actuators and the restricted plasmonic peaks amplitude (compared to the solar spectrum). Herein, the design and fabrication of an AgNPs-based plasmonic photothermal-hygroscopic actuator integrated with printed cellulose tracks are reported (bioinspired to Geraniaceae seeds structures). The nanocomposite is actuated by sunlight power density (i.e., 1 Sun = 100 mW cm−2). The plasmonic AgNPs are in situ synthesized on the PDMS surface through a one-step and efficient fluoride-assisted synthesis (surface coverage ≈40%). The nanocomposite has a broadband absorbance in the VIS range (>1) and a Photothermal Conversion Efficiency ≈40%. The actuator is designed exploiting a mechanical model that predicted the curvature and forces, featuring a ≈6.8 ± 0.3 s response time, associated with a ≈43% change in curvature and a 0.76 ± 0.02 mN force under 1 Sun irradiation. The plasmonic nanocomposite actuator can be used for multiple tasks, as hinted through illustrative soft robotics demonstrators, thus fostering a bioinspired approach to developing embodied energy systems driven by sunlight.},

abstract = {It has been widely recognised that suture joints play a fundamental role in the exceptional mechanical properties of many biological structures like the cranium and ammonite fossil shells. Up to date, many efforts have been devoted to investigate suture interfaces to predict the relations between the characteristics of its two phases, the teeth and the interface layer, and the structure effective properties. However, in very few works the viscoelasticity of the suture components has been taken into account. To provide a contribution in this limitedly explored research area, this paper describes the mathematical formulation and modelling technique leading to explicit expressions for the effective properties of viscoelastic suture joints with a general trapezoidal waveform. It emerges a strong influence of the suture geometric and mechanical characteristics on the effective properties and a parametric analysis reveals that an auxetic behavior can be obtained simply by tailoring the suture parameters. The effects of adding hierarchy into the above system are also explored and closed-form relations for the effective moduli are derived. Optimal levels of hierarchy can be identified and, similarly to the non-hierarchical case, an auxetic behavior emerges for particular values of the suture parameters. Finally, an extension of the theory to the sinusoidal sutures in biology is reported. By considering the examples of the cranium and the woodpecker beak, it emerges that the first is optimised to obtain high stiffness, while the second to obtain high energy dissipation levels.},

abstract = {The crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus, known as peacock mantis shrimp, employs its hammer-like appendages to attack and destroy the shells of prey with a sequence of two strikes. The first strong strike of about 480 N triggers a cavitation bubble in the seawater, which provokes a successive hit (about twice weaker than the first one and with a time delay of ≈0.5 ms) on the prey upon collapsing. Inspired by this double-impact strategy, this paper presents a set of parametric finite element simulations of single, double and triple mechanical hits, using elastic-plastic targets and rigid-body projectiles, to compute the damage energy of the target. Several sequences of combinations (strong, weak and equal impact energy), different diameters of the projectile, (3, 4, 6) mm, and various time delays between consecutive impacts, taken in the range 0.0–0.8 ms, are tested by keeping the total impact energy of the projectile fixed and equal to 2.27 J. Our results reveal that: (i) the single-impact strategy is the most damaging, (ii) among the double-impact cases the crustacean attack strategy has the most damaging effect, (iii) the triple-impact strategy shows more complex scenarios and different optimal solutions. Our results could be of interest for designing bio-inspired armours.},

abstract = {In recent years, fungi have attracted avid interest from the research community. This interest stems from several motives, including their network creation capabilities and fundamental role in the ecosystem. Controlled laboratory experiments of fungal behaviors are crucial to further understanding their role and functionalities. In this paper, we propose a method for automating the quantification and observation of fungal spores. Our approach consists of four steps: 1) a Z-stack image acquisition of the sample is performed, 2) a detection algorithm is applied to all Z-planes, 3) clustering of spores detected in different Z-planes, 4) determination of the optimal Z-plane for each cluster through an ad-hoc focus measure. We compared the spore count obtained through the automated tool to a manual count and the count obtained by applying the detection algorithm to a single plane. The result is a highly automated, non-invasive tool to determine spore count, estimate each spore depth, and retrieve an all-in-focus image to analyze further.},

abstract = {Patterning of two or more liquids, either homogeneous in each phase or mixed with particles (including biological matter, such as cells and proteins), by controlling their flow dynamics, is relevant to several applications. Examples include dynamic spatial confinement of liquids in microfluidic systems (such as lab-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip devices) or structuring of polymers to modulate various properties (such as strength, conductivity, transparency and surface finishing). State-of-the-art strategies use various technologies, including positioners, shakers and acoustic actuators, which often combine limited versatility of mixing with significant inefficiency, energy consumption, and noise, as well as tendency to increase the temperature of the liquids. Here, we describe a new kind of robotic mixers of liquids, based on electro-responsive smart materials (dielectric elastomer actuators). We show for the first time how an efficient soft robotic device can be used to produce, via combinations of rotations and translations, various spatial patterns in liquids and maintain them stable for a few minutes. Moreover, we show that, as compared to a conventional orbital shaker, the new type of robotic device can mix liquids with a higher efficacy ($\sim$ 94% relative to $\sim$ 80%, after 8 min of mixing) and with a significantly lower increase of the liquids' temperature (+ 1 °C relative to + 5 °C, after 6 h of mixing). This is especially beneficial when mixing should occur according to controllable spatial features and should involve temperature-sensitive matter (such as biological cells, proteins, pre-polymers and other thermolabile molecules).},

abstract = {Accountability for global health issues such as a pandemic and its devastating consequences are usually ascribed to a virus, but a comprehensive view should also take into account the state of the host. Data suggests that excessive nutrition is to blame for a yet unknown but not negligible portion of deaths attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We analyzed the correlation between mean body mass index (BMI) and 2-year coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality rates reported by 181 countries worldwide. Almost two thirds of the countries included had a mean BMI greater or equal to 25, with death rates ranging from 3 to 6,280 per million. Death rates in countries with a mean BMI below 25 ranged from 3 to 1,533. When the analysis was restricted to countries where the extent of testing was deemed more representative of actual mortality, only 20.1% had a mean BMI <25 but the mortality difference persisted. A second analysis looking at pre-vaccination mortality obtained from a different source led to similar conclusions. Due to the nature of the variables, reverse causation can be excluded while common causation can not. A mean BMI <25 for a country seems to spare its citizens from the highest COVID-19 mortality rates. The impact of excess weight on global COVID-19 mortality is suspected to have been much higher than what currently perceived, here estimated at no less than a fourfold increase in mortality. Countries with normal mean BMI constitute precious test beds for the quantification of the effects of overeating on COVID-19 mortality.},

abstract = {The current study investigates the body-environment interaction and exploits the passive viscoelastic properties of the body to perform undulatory locomotion. The investigations are carried out using a mathematical model based on a dry frictional environment, and the results are compared with the performance obtained using a physical model. The physical robot is a wheel-based modular system with flexible joints moving on different substrates. The influence of the spatial distribution of body stiffness on speed performance is also investigated. Our results suggest that the environment affects the performance of undulatory locomotion based on the distribution of body stiffness. While stiffness may vary with the environment, we have established a qualitative constitutive law that holds across environments. Specifically, we expect the stiffness distribution to exhibit either an ascending-descending or an ascending-plateau pattern along the length of the object, from head to tail. Furthermore, undulatory locomotion showed sensitivity to contact mechanics: solid-solid or solid-viscoelastic contact produced different locomotion kinematics. Our results elucidate how terrestrial limbless animals achieve undulatory locomotion performance by exploiting the passive properties of the environment and the body. Application of the results obtained may lead to better performing long-segmented robots that exploit the suitability of passive body dynamics and the properties of the environment in which they need to move.},

abstract = {The manufacturing of high-modulus, high-strength fibers is of paramount importance for real-world, high-end applications. In this respect, carbon nanotubes represent the ideal candidates for realizing such fibers. However, their remarkable mechanical performance is difficult to bring up to the macroscale, due to the low load transfer within the fiber. A strategy to increase such load transfer is the introduction of chemical linkers connecting the units, which can be obtained, for example, using carbon ion-beam irradiation. In this work, we investigate, via molecular dynamics simulations, the mechanical properties of twisted nanotube bundles in which the linkers are composed of interstitial single carbon atoms. We find a significant interplay between the twist and the percentage of linkers. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of two different force fields for the description of these systems: the dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent potential, which we couple for non-bonded interaction with either the AIREBO potential or the screened potential ReboScr2. We show that both of these potentials show some shortcomings in the investigation of the mechanical properties of bundles with carbon linkers.},

abstract = {Visual sensors for relative humidity (RH) are of interest for distributed and autonomous environmental monitoring. Most of the visual humidity sensors are based on colorimetric sensing through the employment of hygroscopic inorganic pigments or photonic crystals (PCs). However, the toxicity of some inorganic pigments poses a risk to the environment especially if dispersed during in-situ measurements. On the other hand, the angle-dependent structural colours reading of the PCs, make these devices non suitable for autonomous and in-situ environmental monitoring. Here, we report the first visual humidity sensor using an artificial and hygroscopic seed-like robot (I-SeedPel) recently (2023) developed by our group for hygro-driven environmental exploration (https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202205146). The I-SeedPel design is bioinspired to the hygroscopic and layered tissues of the Pelargonium appendiculatum seed and fabricated through additive manufacturing techniques using biodegradable polymers. The hygro-mechanical response of the I-SeedPel generates a reversible change of the geometrical features in the artificial seed structure (i.e., awn's angular displacement and diameter variation) related to the RH. The variation of the geometric properties can be quantified and correlated to RH in a wide range (30–90 %), with an accuracy of 97–98 %, with a resolution of 0.17–0.52 % of RH and a good reproducibility (average RSD = 14.7 %).},

abstract = {The University Proton Therapy facility in Dresden (UPTD), Germany, is equipped with an experimental room with a beamline providing a static pencil beam. High proton beam currents can be achieved at this beamline which makes it suitable for FLASH experiments. However, the established experimental setup uses only the entrance channel of the proton Bragg curve. In this work, a set of 3D-printed range modulators designed to generate spread out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) for radiobiological experiments at ultra-high dose rate at this beamline is described. A new method to optimize range modulators specifically for the case of a static pencil beam based on the central depth dose profile is introduced. Modulators for two different irradiation setups were produced and characterized experimentally by measurements of lateral and depth dose distributions using different detectors. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess profiles of the dose averaged linear energy transfer (LETD) in water. These newly produced range modulators will allow future proton FLASH experiments in the SOBP at UPTD with two different experimental setups.},

abstract = {Nowadays, safety devices (e.g., helmets, safety barriers, body protectors, etc.) producers are developing and testing innovative smart materials to reach the ever-growing request for higher performances arising from international standards and markets. Shear thickening fluids (STFs) have attracted special attention because of their non-linear mechanical response and high-energy dissipation effectiveness. In particular, within STF, shear thickening gels (STGs), a class of high-molecular-weight and crosslinked polymers have exhibited great stability and shear-dependent properties ascribable to the presence of dynamic boron-oxygen crosslinks within the polymeric structure. Hence, it is essential to investigate the rheological behavior of these system for their application in new flexible and impact protection devices. This review focuses on the description of the peculiar advantages of using STFs with regards to traditional materials in sport protective equipment. Moreover, the preparation and use of STFs for impact protection including all the scientific productions and the conspicuous patent literature on this field - from dilatant suspension until the latest STGs–have been reviewed in detail. Commercial helmets and body protectors containing STFs have also been reviewed and reported. Finally, the use of STGs not embedded in foams in sport helmet is also discussed and a final part on future perspective of STFs for sport protection is provided.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the possibility of achieving tunable topologically protected edge modes through the application of uniaxial prestrain in an auxetic metamaterial. The proposed structure consists of a thin slab with oriented cuts in a hexagonal lattice, where topologically protected band gaps are opened by introducing a controlled variation in selected cut lengths. Numerical simulations demonstrate the existence of topologically protected and scatter-free wave propagation in the structure at the interface between two subdomains with modified cells, in distinct frequency ranges. For the metamaterial considered in this study, this happens only in the presence of auxeticity. In addition, exploiting geometrical nonlinearity, the application of a uniaxial prestrain can be used to close the band gaps or to modify their frequency range, i.e., to weaken the localization effects or to shift the frequency at which they occur. The spatial and temporal variation of the applied strain field can thus be used for the dynamic tuning of metamaterial topological waveguiding properties, with applications in mechanical devices for logic operations and computation.},

Following a bioinspired approach, the internal structure and biomechanics of Pelargonium appendiculatum (L.f.) Willd seeds are investigated to develop a model for the design of a soft robot. The authors exploit the re-shaping ability of 4D printed materials to fabricate a seed-like soft robot, according to the natural specifications and model, and using biodegradable and hygroscopic polymers. The robot mimics the movement and performances of the natural seed, reaching a torque value of ≈30 µN m, an extensional force of ≈2.5 mN and it is capable to lift ≈100 times its own weight.

abstract = {Acoustic noise production during Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an important source of patient discomfort and leads to verbal communication problems, difficulties in sedation, and hearing impairment. To address these issues, in this paper we present a systematic characterization of the acoustic field distribution in a MRI cavity in a last generation 7 T scanner, in different spatial locations, with and without a phantom head. Analysis and comparison of various MRI sequences like Echo-planar imaging”, “Gradient echo”, “Spin echo” are carried out. Sound pressure levels are measured using standard statistical descriptors ((Formula presented.) (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.)) using two prepolarized free-field microphones measuring pressure levels generated inside scanner cavities in a 50 Hz to 10 kHz range. Acoustic eigenmodes of the cavity are derived numerically in finite element simulations and compared to measurements. Equivalent sound pressure levels exceed 85 dB in the range between 500 and 3,000 Hz, and peak levels are consistently above 100 dB, i.e., the noise levels of 7 T scanners are higher than 3T and 1.5 T counterparts. The presence of the phantom head in the MRI scanner leads to increased noise levels (by 5–10 dB) in its vicinity, as a result of reflections occurring between the head and the bore reflective walls. Numerical finite element simulations allow to extrapolate the noise distribution in the entire cavity and to interpret experimental results and indicate that the frequencies at which the highest noise levels occur correspond to azimuthal or radial resonant modes of the MRI cavity, i.e., with a radially and azimuthally varying pressure field. These results can be useful for the design of future acoustic noise mitigation solutions.},

abstract = {Spider silk fibers are of scientific and industrial interest because of their extraordinary mechanical properties. These properties are normally determined by tensile tests, but the values obtained are dependent on the morphology of the fibers, the test conditions, and the methods by which stress and strain are calculated. Because of this, results from many studies are not directly comparable, which has led to widespread misconceptions in the field. Here, we critically review most of the reports from the past 50 years on spider silk mechanical performance and use artificial spider silk and native silks as models to highlight the effect that different experimental setups have on the fibers' mechanical properties. The results clearly illustrate the importance of carefully evaluating the tensile test methods when comparing the results from different studies. Finally, we suggest a protocol for how to perform tensile tests on silk and biobased fibers.},

abstract = {Tantalum oxides (Ta2O5) are characterized by attractive physical and chemical properties, such as high dielectric constants and anti-reflection behaviour. In principle, their electronic properties can be accurately investigated from first-principles simulations. However, the existence of several stable polymorphs of these oxides represents a major difficulty to calculate and disentangle their respective spectral features. To determine the ground-state structure of the thermally grown oxide, we use linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations for investigating the energy loss function in the optical limit of various polymorphs. We show that the experimental energy loss signal, extracted from the reflection energy loss spectra (REELS) recorded on a thermally grown thin film, can be rationalized and interpreted by assuming that the $\gamma$-phase of Ta2O5 represents the underlying structural model of the oxide. We find that the inclusion of both local field effects and spin–orbit coupling is crucial to compute the energy loss function of these materials. Finally, to further validate the $\gamma$-Ta2O5 polymorph as a model of the experimental tantalum oxide, we compute the REELS spectra using a Monte Carlo approach, finding an excellent agreement with the as-acquired experimental data.},

abstract = {Nature's intricate designs and efficient functionality have evolved over millions of years to thrive in challenging environments while minimizing energy consumption and ecological impact. Inspired by nature's strategies, the manufacturing industry and academic research strive to develop materials and designs that exhibit high strength. The octopus, a remarkable marine creature, exemplifies a complex and adaptive design. It has eight arms aligned with numerous tactile suction cups having a specialized geometry and cavity. This study employed fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers to model and fabricate octopus-inspired suction cups. We examined different aspect ratios and shapes of cavities, such as cuboids, cylinders, and octopus suction cup cavities, while maintaining similar outer geometry. The compressive test proved that the inside cavity plays a significant role in enhancing strength due to stress distribution and is represented as a robust biomimetic design. The finite element analysis (FEA) is also developed to corroborate the experimental findings. The statistical validation of the experimental results is achieved through a multilinear regression equation. Our findings demonstrate that the naturally evolved octopus structure exhibits superior compressive strength, enhanced energy absorption, and the ability to generate negative pressure, rendering it highly suitable for gripping, suction, and shock-absorption applications.},

abstract = {This study encompasses the passive interdependence of body material (internal damping, stiffness, and geometry) and environmental (frictional anisotropy and frictional coefficients) properties on the performance and adaptability of undulatory locomotion. Undulatory locomotion is modeled in viscous and hybrid environments. The body's ability to adapt passively results in different locomotion gaits, such as swimming and crawling. Results show that, in swimming gaits, body stiffness dominates frictional forces, whereas in crawling gaits, frictional forces dominate body stiffness. Our result showed that the interdependence between endogenous and exogenous dynamics can be utilized to achieve the desired speed. The hybrid frictional environment is modeled as the combination of dry and viscous frictions and recognized as a valuable asset in the modeling of undulatory locomotion in granular media. In the hybrid environment the respective ratios of dry and viscous frictions play an essential role in the speed optimization. The optimal combination of dry and viscous frictions can be found depending on the characteristics of the body and environment. We validate the viscous based frictional model using the properties of the body of Caenorhabditis Elegans from the state of the art, in a viscous environment. The results can be employed to design robotic solutions to perform optimally in different environments and with customized body properties.},

abstract = {Multiscale phenomena exhibit complex structure-function relationships, and predicting their macroscopic behavior requires deducing differential equations at different scales. The complexity of these equations and the number of essential parameters make developing effective, predictive models challenging. To overcome this, researchers explore leveraging advanced numerical techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning. Here, we focus on a fundamental aspect in multiscale phenomena, i.e the recognition of the hierarchical role of variables. By adopting a Pareto front interpretation, we aim to deduce simple and accurate relations for material modeling, starting from experimental multiscale analyses. From a physical point of view, the aim is to deduce information at higher scales from lower scales data, possibly respecting their hierarchical order. A crucial aspect of the proposed approach is the deduction of causality relations among the different variables to be compared with the available theoretical notions and possibly new interpretations resulting by the data modelling. This result in a stepwise approximation going from data modelling to theoretical equations and back to data modelling. To demonstrate the key advantages of our multiscale numerical approach, compared to classical, non-physically based data modelling techniques, we consider the explicit example of spider silk, known for its exceptional properties and bioinspiration potential. Indeed, it presents a complex behavior resulting from mesostructures formed by the aggregation of amino acids at the molecular scale. We argue that, due to the generality of our results, our approach may represent a proof of concept in many fields where multiscale, hierarchical differential equations regulate the observed phenomenon.},

Here, we report the Young's modulus (E = 1.11 ± 0.04 TPa), tensile strength ($\sigma$ = 27.40 ± 4.36 GPa), and failure strain ($\epsilon$ f = 6.01 ± 0.92 %) of centimeter-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene (SCG) ‘dog bone' samples with edges aligned along the zigzag (zz) direction, supported by an ultra-thin polymer (polycarbonate) film. For samples with edges along the armchair (ac) direction, we obtain E = 1.01 ± 0.10 TPa, $\sigma$ = 20.21 ± 3.22 GPa, $\epsilon$ f = 3.69 ± 0.38 %, and for chiral samples whose edges were between zz and ac, we obtain E= 0.75 ± 0.12 TPa, $\sigma$ = 23.56 ± 3.42 GPa, and $\epsilon$ f = 4.53 ± 0.40 %. The SCG is grown on single crystal Cu(111) foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We used a home-built ‘float-on-water' (FOW) tensile testing system for tensile loading measurements that also enabled in situ crack observation. The quantized fracture mechanics (QFM) analysis predicts an edge defect size from several to tens of nanometers based on chirality and notch angle. Through Weibull analysis and given that the fatal defects are confined on the edges of macroscale samples, we projected strength ranging from 13.67 to 18.43 GPa for an A4-size SCG according to their chirality. Our findings demonstrate exceptional mechanical performance of macroscale single crystal graphene (SCG) and pave the way for its widespread use in a very wide variety of applications.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the manufacturing process provide a possibility of fabricating a new generation of porous materials denoted by functionally graded porous materials (FGPM). This paper aims to present a time domain analysis of wave propagation through the porous structures with functionally graded porosity distribution, which has not been completely studied before. For this purpose, the beams with different functionally graded porosity distributions subjected to both axial and transverse tip impact loads with a high-frequency content are investigated. The shear deformable cantilevered functionally graded porous beams with various porosity distributions through the beam thickness are studied. The governing differential equations are derived using the Hamiltonian principle based on the Timoshenko beam theory. A locking-free first-order shear deformable beam element is used to derive the finite element formulation of the equations. The Newmark time integration method is used to perform a time domain analysis of the equations of motion and to investigate the transient response of the beams. The axial and transverse wave propagation characteristics through functionally graded (FG) porous beams are found using time domain analysis of the results. Deflection and velocity time histories of the tip and each point of the beam, reflection time, and variation of support reactions are obtained. The influences of the porosity magnitude and porosity distribution on the wave propagation characteristics and overall time responses are investigated. The results reveal that porosity distribution has a significant effect on the wave amplitude, wave speed, and reflection from the boundary. Also, this study can help in a better understanding of porous structures' behavior subjected to high-transient impact loads in different engineering applications.},

abstract = {Many works in elasticity have exploited the concept of gradient-index (GRIN) lenses, borrowed from optics, for wave focusing and control. These effects are particularly attractive for cloaking, absorption, or energy-harvesting applications. Despite their potential, current lens designs suffer from limitations, mainly related to the difficulty of imaging pointlike sources. Here, we exploit an alternative GRIN lens design that enables a one-to-one correspondence between input and output phase and allows the focal length to be determined using the well-known thin-lens equation, effectively establishing an elastic equivalent of the convex lens in optics. This is demonstrated analytically, obtaining a bijective relation between the location of a pointlike source and its image. The results are also confirmed numerically and experimentally in an aluminum plate, in which the lens is realized by introducing rows of circular cavities of variable diameter. Moreover, a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the possibility of imaging sources of flexural waves at the centimeter scale with subwavelength resolution. This research can extend applications of elastic GRIN lenses to new fields such as imaging and nondestructive testing, in which the locations of defects can be identified by focusing the scattered field. Multiple sources can be imaged simultaneously, and the combined effects of multiple lenses can also be used to design more complex systems, opening new possibilities for the technological exploitation of elastic wave manipulation.},

abstract = {Tendons play a pivotal role in facilitating joint movement by transmitting muscular forces to bones. The intricate hierarchical structure and diverse material composition of tendons contribute to their non-linear mechanical response. However, comprehensively grasping their mechanical properties poses a challenge due to inherent variability in biological tissues. This necessitates a thorough examination of uncertainties associated with properties measurements, particularly under diverse loading conditions. Given the cyclic loading experienced by tendons throughout an individual's lifespan, understanding their mechanical behaviour under such circumstances becomes crucial. This study addresses this need by introducing a generalised Paris Erdogan Law tailored for non-linear materials. To examine uncertainties within this proposed framework, Monte Carlo Analysis is employed. This approach allows for a thorough exploration of the uncertainties associated with tendon mechanics, contributing to a more robust comprehension of their behaviour under cyclic loading conditions. Finally, self-healing has been integrated into the fatigue law of tendons through the proposal of a healing function, formulated as a polynomial function of the maximum stress. This approach allows to account for an increase in the number of cycles for each stress value due to self-repair after the damage event generated by long-term cycling load over the individual's life span.},

Even though the introduction of non-local elastic links in metamaterials has unlocked unprecedented possibilities, literature models and prototypes seem neither to provide criteria to compare local and non-local lattices nor to discuss any related rules governing the transition between the two configurations. A physically reasonable principle that monoatomic one-dimensional chains must obey to pass from single- to multi-connected systems is here proposed through a mass conservation law for elastic springs thereby introducing a suitable real dimensionless parameter $\alpha$ to tune stiffness distribution. Therefore, the dispersion relations as a function of $\alpha$ and of the degree of non-locality P are derived analytically, demonstrating that the proposed principle can be rather interpreted as a general mechanical consistency condition to preserve proper dynamics, involving the spring-to-bead mass ratio. Finally, after discussing qualitative results and deriving some useful inequalities, numerical simulations and two-dimensional FFTs are performed for some paradigmatic examples to highlight key dynamics features exhibited by chains with finite length as the parameters $\alpha$ and P vary.

abstract = {Biodegradable vascular stents (BVS) are deemed as great potential alternatives for overcoming the inherent limitations of permanent metallic stents in the treatment of coronary artery diseases. The current study aimed to comprehensively compare the mechanical behaviors of four poly(lactic acid) (PLA) BVS designs with varying geometries via numerical methods and to clarify the optimal BVS selection. Four PLA BVS (i.e., Absorb, DESolve, Igaki-Tamai, and Fantom) were first constructed. A degradation model was refined by simply including the fatigue effect induced by pulsatile blood pressures, and an explicit solver was employed to simulate the crimping and degradation behaviors of the four PLA BVS. The degradation dynamics here were characterized by four indices. The results indicated that the stent designs affected crimping and degradation behaviors. Compared to the other three stents, the DESolve stent had the greatest radial stiffness in the crimping simulation and the best diameter maintenance ability despite its faster degradation; moreover, the stent was considered to perform better according to a pilot scoring system. The current work provides a theoretical method for studying and understanding the degradation dynamics of the PLA BVS, and it could be helpful for the design of next-generation BVS.},

abstract = {The introduction of metamaterials has provided new possibilities to manipulate the propagation of waves in different fields of physics, ranging from electromagnetism to acoustics. However, despite the variety of configurations proposed so far, most solutions lack dynamic tunability, i.e. their functionality cannot be altered post-fabrication. Our work overcomes this limitation by employing a photo-responsive polymer to fabricate a simple metamaterial structure and enable tuning of its elastic properties using visible light. The structure of the metamaterial consists of graded resonators in the form of an array of pillars, each giving rise to different resonances and transmission band gaps. Selective laser illumination can then tune the resonances and their frequencies individually or collectively, thus yielding many degrees of freedom in the tunability of the filtered or transmitted wave frequencies, similar to playing a keyboard, where illuminating each pillar corresponds to playing a different note. This concept can be used to realize low-power active devices for elastic wave control, including beam splitters, switches and filters.

abstract = {Coalescence-induced condensation droplet jumping has been extensively studied for anti-icing, condensation heat transfer, water harvesting, and self-cleaning. Another phenomenon that is gaining attention for potential enhancements is the self-ejection of individual droplets. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive due to cases in which the abrupt detachment of an interface establishes an initial Laplace pressure difference. In this study, we investigate the self-ejection of individual droplets from uniformly hydrophobic microstructures with divergent geometries. We design, fabricate, and test arrays of truncated, nanostructured, and hydrophobic microcones arranged in a square pattern. High-speed microscopy reveals the dynamics of a single condensation droplet between four cones: after cycles of growth and stopped self-propulsion, the suspended droplet self-ejects without abrupt detachments. Through analytical modeling of the droplet in a conical pore as an approximation, we describe the slow isopressure growth phases and the rapid transients driven by surface energy release once a dynamic configuration is reached. Microcones with uniform wettability, in addition to being easier to fabricate, have the potential to enable the self-ejection of all nucleated droplets with a designed size, promising significant improvements in the aforementioned applications and others.},

abstract = {The current paper extends the classic Gibson-Ashby model of cellular solids for repetitive graded lattices. Three well-known porous unit cells, i.e., simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and their combination (BCC＋), are considered and the corresponding graded lattices are geometrically defined by functional variation in the diameters of the ligaments based on a power law. The analytical expressions for the relative elastic modulus of the cells, which vary along the graded direction, are provided by structural analysis of the representative beam framework containing tapered beams using the Euler–Bernoulli theory. After that, continuous approximation functions for variation of the relative density and the relative elastic modulus are presented by curve fitting over the analytical expressions along the graded direction. Then, the graded lattices are considered to be fully homogenized and as a homogeneous media, the exact expressions for the effective relative density and the effective relative modulus are presented. The modified version of the Gibson-Ashby model is proposed to relate the effective relative modulus to the effective relative density by introducing a correction factor to the classic model. It is shown that the classic Gibson-Ashby model with the coefficients fitted on uniform lattices, is not accurate for relating the effective properties of the graded lattices. The proposed model, presented as an analytical expression with fitting parameters and a correction factor, serves as a useful guideline for designing optimized functionally graded lattice structures, accommodating a wide range of geometric variations.},

In this work, the micromechanics of Ti3C2Tx MXene-reinforced poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposites have been studied in detail. Ti3C2Tx MXene/PVA nanocomposites were prepared by solution blending. The spatial orientation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in the nanocomposites was characterized by polarized Raman spectroscopy and the orientation factor was correlated to the effective Young's modulus of the flakes through well-established micromechanical theories. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were evaluated by tensile testing. A 27% increase in Young's modulus and a 24% improvement in tensile strength were achieved by addition of only 0.6 wt% Ti3C2Tx. Efficient stress transfer from the polymer matrix to Ti3C2Tx MXene in bulk nanocomposites has been observed through strain-induced Raman band shifts for the first time. The effective Young's modulus of the MXene nanoplatelets was calculated to be in the order of 300 GPa, in good agreement with the values derived from the application of micromechanical models.},

abstract = {Inspired by nature, porous graded topological structures based on carbon, like Schwarzites and Schwartzynes, exhibit a distinctive radial-gradient distribution of pores. The pores are strategically arranged in two patterns: small pores at the centre and larger pores in the outer region ($\psi$), and larger pores at the centre with smaller pores in the outer region ($\Omega$). This type of topological engineering, with its unique deformation behaviour, makes these structures highly suitable for engineering applications requiring high energy absorption. However, the existence of stress-concentration regions within the porous graded structures leads to premature structural failure during uni-axial compression. To enhance the mechanical properties of such porous graded structures, this study proposes a strategy of tailoring their pores' deformation characteristics by replacing the stress concentration regions with soft/flexible materials. The selective reinforcing two ($\psi$2) and three layers ($\Omega$3) soft material enhances the specific yield strength of the multi-material composite by 187.27 % and 230.22 %, respectively compared to the respective porous soft structures. Specific resilience is heightened by 289.93 % and 323.82 % for multi-material composite $\psi$2 and $\Omega$3, w.r.t the respective porous hard structure($\psi$0′ and $\Omega$0,). Our results present a unique strategy for improving the structural performance of the porous graded structures by tailoring the deformation characteristics. Engineered multi-material-based advanced composites, resulting from this approach, exhibit significant potential for applications requiring energy absorption without failure.},

abstract = {Silk-based materials are sought after across various industries due to their remarkable properties, including high strength and flexibility. However, their practical application depends largely on how well these properties are maintained under different environmental conditions. Despite significant advancements in the large-scale production of artificial silk fibers, the effects of temperature on their mechanical behavior are understudied. In this study, the mechanical properties of artificial spider silk fibers between −80 and +120 °C are examined and compared to both synthetic and natural silk fibers. The findings reveal that artificial silk fibers maintain their strength up to +120 °C, though the strain at break slightly decreases, remaining above 60%. At −80 °C, the fibers exhibit increased strength, but the strain at break is reduced. While these artificial fibers closely mimic the behavior of natural silk, they show a noticeable reduction in extensibility at low temperatures. Complementing experimental data, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis are also conducted, proposing a simple physical model to explain the observed temperature-induced softening. Encouragingly, the degradation temperature of artificial silk is comparable to that of native silkworm and spider silk. This study underscores the importance of enhancing the mechanical robustness of artificial silk to expand its applications.},

The barrier comprises a cubic locally resonating unit made of four concrete pyramids connected together by external slender steel rebars. The unit cell is characterized from the dynamic point of view both numerically and experimentally, and a full-scale field test is then performed on the barrier at the railway station in Elze (Germany).

abstract = {Topological protection has opened new possibilities for unconventional wave guiding, object cloaking, improved energy transport, as well as surface, edge, or corner mode localization. In elasticity, these phenomena have largely been explored and exemplified through discrete models having nearest neighbor couplings. Interactions beyond the nearest neighbors in one-dimensional studies, on the other hand, have recently shown great potential for topological wave phenomena. In this work we investigate the topological modes of a two-dimensional mass–spring hexagonal lattice with connections between both nearest and third nearest neighboring masses. We show that non-nearest connections allow for (i) the formation of additional Dirac cones and (ii) a migration in their location in the reciprocal space as a function of the relative stiffness between nearest and third nearest neighbor connections. These additional Dirac cones are linked to a corresponding increase in the number of topological edge modes, which hybridize and result in bound modes at interfaces between lattices that are inverted copies of each other. Explicit expressions for the mode shapes and frequencies of these bound modes are derived and their topological origin is elucidated. We also demonstrate that by varying the relative stiffness between nearest and third nearest neighbor connections, bound modes lying in the band gap can be achieved. While in the case of only nearest neighbor connections the bound modes are at a fixed frequency in the pass band, varying the stiffness of a single nonlocal spring can shift their frequency and isolate them as desired within a band gap. Transient numerical simulations conducted on a finite lattice allow to quantify the confinement along the transverse direction as a wave propagates in a waveguide with sharp turns, reporting negligible backscattering. Finally, a possible realization of hexagonal unit cells with third nearest neighbor connections is proposed. The concepts here presented open novel avenues for topological wave guiding and confinement leveraging bound modes to design waveguides with superior energy localization potential.},

Coalescence-induced condensation droplets jumping (CICDJ), enabled on highly hydrophobic surfaces, is already exploited to slow down the frosting but it is insufficient to completely eliminate the propagation by ice-bridging. The study shows here how the self-ejection of single condensation droplets can fully frustrate all the ice bridges, resulting in a frost velocity lower than 0.5 µm s−1 and thus falling below the current limits of passive surfaces. Arrays of truncated microcones, covered by uniformly hydrophobic nanostructures, enable individual condensation droplets to grow and self-propel toward the top of the microstructures and then to self-eject once a precise volume is reached. The independency of self-ejection on the neighbor droplets allows a fine control of the droplets size and distance distributions and thus the ice-bridging frustration. The truncated microcones with the smallest heads area fraction maximize the percentage of self-ejecting droplets and minimize the frost velocity. The ice bridges frustration also implies a small frost area coverage, highly desirable in aeronautics and thermal machines.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider experimental data available for graphene-based nanolubricants to evaluate their convective heat transfer performance by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Single-phase models with temperature-dependent properties are employed for this purpose. The base fluid is a polyalkylene glycol, and we show the effect of the addition of carbon nanohorns and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), in different volume fractions, on the convective heat transfer coefficient between two parallel plates. Then, an application to hydrodynamic lubrication is discussed. The extreme in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene allows a smaller temperature rise of the GNP-based nanolubricant, i.e., a more effective heat removal. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of single-phase nanofluid models to hydrodynamic lubrication.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, micro-texturing has become a widely studied technique to modify the frictional behavior between surfaces in both dry and lubricated regimes. Among all the available techniques, the Laser Surface Texturing (LST) appears to be fast, clean and flexible, and thus a good candidate in realizing surface micropatterns, also for the improvement of the tribological performance of automotive components when subjected to dry friction. For this reason, in the present work, the tribological response of four different patterns of micro-holes on two contrasting materials, specifically Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Carbon (C) have been investigated with a coupled experimental-numerical approach. The static and the dynamic friction coefficients have been extracted from the 25 different combinations of these surface textures including the flat counterparts. Then, the influence of the holes diameter, their density and the material has been studied thanks to a multivariate linear regression. Specifically, it emerged that, in a dry regime, the most emerging parameter is the micro-holes diameter, for both static and dynamic friction. Moreover, for both static and dynamic friction, the material which more influences the effects of patterns to the overall frictional behavior is here the stiffest one. These insights for the design of micro-patterned surfaces with controlled frictional properties could be useful for those applications in which a dry friction regime is present.},

abstract = {Self-locking structures are often studied in macroscopic energy absorbers, but the concept of self-locking can also be effectively applied at the nanoscale. In particular, we can engineer self-locking mechanisms at the molecular level through careful shape selection or chemical functionalisation. The present work focuses on the use of collapsed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as self-locking elements. We start by inserting a thin CNT into each of the two lobes of a collapsed larger CNT. We aim to create a system that utilises the unique properties of CNTs to achieve stable configurations and enhanced energy absorption capabilities at the nanoscale. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of periodic systems realised with such units. This approach extends the application of self-locking mechanisms and opens up new possibilities for the development of advanced materials and devices.},

The recent scientific literature is exploring the possibility of leveraging machine learning, with a predominant focus on neural networks, excelling in data fitting, but often lacking insight into essential physical information. We propose the adoption of a symbolic data modeling technique, the “Evolutionary Polynomial Regression,” which integrates regression capabilities with the genetic programming paradigm, enabling the derivation of explicit analytical formulas, finally delivering a deeper comprehension of the analyzed physical phenomenon. To demonstrate the key advantages of our multiscale numerical approach, we consider the spider silk case. Based on a recent multiscale experimental dataset, we deduce the dependence of the macroscopic behavior from lower-scale parameters, also offering insights for improving a recent theoretical model by some of the authors. Our approach may represent a proof of concept for modeling in fields governed by multiscale, hierarchical differential equations.},

abstract = {The mechanics of the trabecular bone is related to its structure; this work aimed to propose a simple projection method to clarify the correlation between the principal mechanical direction (PMD) and the principal microstructural direction (PMSD) of trabecular bones from osteoporotic femoral heads. A total of 529 trabecular cubes were cropped from five osteoporotic femoral heads. The micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) sequential images of each cube were first projected onto the three Cartesian coordinate planes to have three overlapped images, and the trabecular orientation distribution in the three images was analyzed. The PMSD corresponding to the greatest distribution frequency of the trabecular orientation in the three images was defined. Then, the voxel finite element (FE) models of the cubes were reconstructed and simulated to obtain their compliance matrices, and the matrices were subjected to transversal rotation to find their maximum elastic constants. The PMD corresponding to the maximum elastic constant was defined. Subsequently, the correlation of the defined PMSD and PMD was analyzed. The results showed that PMSD and PMD of the trabecular cubes did not show a significant difference at the xy- and yz-planes except that at the zx-plane. Despite this, the mean PMSD-PMD deviations at the three coordinate planes were close to 0°, and the PMSD-PMD fitting to the line PMSD = PMD demonstrated their high correlation. This study might be helpful to identify the loading direction of anisotropic trabecular bones in experiments by examining the PMSD and also to guide bone scaffold design for bone tissue repair.

abstract = {Before humans and allegedly any animal group, spiders developed “functionally graded toothed blades” that cut one of the toughest biological materials: silk. Here, this work reveals the importance of micro-structured serrations in spiders' fangs that allow these animals to cut silk and artificial high-performance fibers, such as carbon or Kevlar. The importance of serrations revolves around the stress concentration at the interface between the fang and the fibers, resulting in a cutting efficiency superior to that of a razor blade. This efficiency is increased by the presence of pretension in the fibers and is high also for fibers with different diameters like silk, because of the serration grading that allows a smart positioning of the fiber in the optimal cutting condition. This work proposes that when the silk fiber is grasped by the fang, it slides along the serrated edge till it gets locked in the serration with a comparable size, where the load to cut is minimal. These results provide a new perspective on cutting mechanisms and set the roots for spider fang-inspired cutting tools.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel micromechanics model tailored for dissolvable composites, where the inclusion undergoes dissolution and diffusion within the matrix, with the aim of analytically predicting the time-dependent properties of composites. The dissolution of inclusion leads to a reduction of its volume fraction and the formation of a growing interphase layer around the inclusion. This versatile model is applicable to both short-term dissolutions, as observed in the fabrication process of composites and long-term degradation occurring in high-temperature or corrosive environments, common in industrial and biological applications. Dimensionless expressions for time-dependent volume fractions of composite components are related to the dissolution and the diffusion rates, and a micromechanics three-phase model is established to evaluate the properties of the composite as a function of dissolution time. A detailed parametric study is performed to demonstrate the effect of all the parameters on the final properties. The model is successfully applied to the experimental data in the literature to show its capability and flexibility in predicting the practical dissolution examinations. The introduced model provides a pioneering framework for the future evolution of the dissolvable micromechanics concept.},

abstract = {A major aspiration in advanced materials is to create artificial adhesive surfaces for wearable medical devices to meet the demands of the body's challenging settings and dynamics. For instance, dentures replace missing teeth and operate within the oral cavity, where an interplay between forces, muscles, saliva, and roughness of mucosa undermine their ability to grip oral tissues. Consequently, the lack of effective retentive strategies represents a source of dissatisfaction for denture wearers globally. Nature is rich in examples that employ physical and chemical adhesive strategies to optimize interfacial forces in dry and wet environments. Here, keratin-coated octopus-like suction cups are presented at the micro- and macroscale to improve the retention of rigid poly(methyl methacrylate). Microtopographies are obtained using two-photon polymerization and maskless lithography, while denture prototypes with macrotopographies are derived via digital light processing 3D printing. Results suggest that microtopographies and keratin-coated surfaces sustain higher maximum adhesion stress than the non-topographical and non-coated surfaces in moist environments, where retention is typically lacking. Proof-of-concept dentures demonstrate higher maximum detachment forces than conventional dentures with and without denture adhesive within dry and wet environments. This interdisciplinary research highlights the potential application of a nature-inspired physico-chemical approach in the next generation of complete dentures.},

abstract = {Many terrestrial ecosystems engage mycorrhizal symbiotic associations, potentially to enhance nutrition, increase resistance to soil-borne pests and diseases, and improve resilience and soil structure. Mycorrhizal fungi create dynamic networked structures through branching and anastomosis that connect multiple plants and consent to transport resources underground from nutrient-rich patches to demanding plants. Controlled laboratory experiments are fundamental to improving our knowledge of mycelium network growth dynamics and further understanding its role in preserving ecological niches. We propose a method for highly automated analysis of the mycelium network structure and other morphological properties, such as hyphal length, hyphal density, and number of crossing and branches, in 2D microscopy images of fungal samples. Available tools for automated network analyses suffer from overestimating network connectivity since filament crossings are not considered. In particular, we propose a) a ridge-based mycelium detection algorithm and b) a geometrical-based approach to identify overlapping filaments crossing each other. The algorithmic solution is evaluated on a total of 135 real mycelium sample images over different validation steps, originating from different datasets and having different characteristics, including background, contrast, image acquisition system, fungal species, and clearness (e.g., level of transparency, homogeneity, dirtiness of the medium) of the sample. Results show that 1) the proposed detection method can be used to measure the length of mycelium in an image, replacing manual tracing and allowing for less laborious analysis $\rho$̂c=0.96, 2) the filament detection is on par with state-of-the-art techniques F1=0.88−0.94 with a more intuitive parameterization, and 3) the proposed algorithm correctly identifies filament crossings F1=0.89 in most common cases, yielding a reduction in the overestimation of network connectivity. The latter feature consents to applying the proposed fully automated solution to complex and irregular fungal structures, advancing mycelium detection and reconstruction performance accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art.},

We have created a magnetic hybrid material by coupling silk fibroin─i.e., a natural biopolymer with an optimal combination of biocompatibility and mechanical robustness─with the FeCo alloy, the ferromagnetic material with the highest saturation magnetization. The material is in the form of a 6 $\mu$m-thick silk fibroin film, coated with a FeCo layer (nominal thickness: 10 nm) grown by magnetron sputtering deposition. The sputtering deposition technique is versatile and eco-friendly and proves effective for growing the magnetic layer on the biopolymer substrate, also allowing one to select the area to be decorated. The hybrid material is biocompatible, lightweight, flexible, robust, and water-resistant. Electrical, structural, mechanical, and magnetic characterization of the material, both as-prepared and after being soaked in water, have provided information on the adhesion between the silk fibroin substrate and the FeCo layer and on the state of internal mechanical stresses. The hybrid film exhibits a high magnetic bending response under a magnetic field gradient, thanks to an ultralow fraction of the FeCo component (less than 0.1 vol %, i.e., well below 1 wt %).

To mitigate the consequences of glass fiber dissolution in glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) pipes, it is essential to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the pipes under internal fluid flow. This paper presents a novel time-dependent micromechanical model and examines the effects of glass fiber dissolution on the instability and vibrational behavior of a composite pipe conveying fluid. The Hamiltonian principle obtains the governing equations of the conveying fluid composite pipe system with fiber dissolution defects. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is then used to solve the eigenvalue problem for the natural frequencies, divergence, and flutter critical velocities of the composite pipe conveying fluid. The effects of different parameters, such as span and amount of dissolution, as well as the quality of the dissolved portion of the fibers, are highlighted on the instability and vibration characteristics of composite pipes. The results show that fiber dissolution significantly affects the behavior of composite pipes conveying fluid. This work also provides a better understanding of the above-mentioned "environmental aging" type in fiber-reinforced composites.},

Wax nanotubules confer high contact angles, enabling coalescence-induced condensation droplet (out-of-plane) jumping, which, as known, contributes to slowing down frost. Another type of movement—this time in-plane—becomes predominant in reducing the frosting velocity (vfrost) within a sub-cooling temperature range. Specifically, supercooled droplets slide toward the frost bridges upon contact, moving in the opposite direction to frost propagation. Between −11 and −2°C, Sliding on Frost (SoF) shifts from being rare to very frequent, reducing vfrost/vbridge from approximately 4 to 1, respectively. Using high-speed microscopy, we observed that the advancing contact angle of supercooled water on ice decreases with temperature. We describe the primary role of this behavior in SoF with a model that accounts for the forces involved and explains the observed transition.},

abstract = {Bioinspiration has widely been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for the design of innovative structures and devices. Recently, this concept has been extended to the field of elasticity, dynamics, and metamaterials. In this paper, we propose a seashell-inspired metasensor that can simultaneously perform spatial frequency mapping and act as a polarizer. The structure emerges from a universal parametric design that encompasses diverse spiral geometries with varying circular cross sections and curvature radii, all leading to tonotopic behavior. Adoption of an optimization process leads to a planar geometry that enables us to simultaneously achieve tonotopy for orthogonally polarized modes, leading to the possibility to control polarization as well as the spatial distribution of frequency maxima along the spiral axis. We demonstrate the versatility of the device and discuss the possible applications in the field of acoustics and sensing.},

abstract = {Plasma membranes appear as deformable systems wherein molecules are free to move and diffuse giving rise to condensed microdomains (composed of ordered lipids, transmembrane proteins and cholesterol) surrounded by disordered lipid molecules. Such denser and thicker regions, namely lipid rafts, are important communication hubs for cells. Indeed, recent experiments revealed how the most of active signaling proteins co-localize on such domains, thereby intensifying the biochemical trafficking of substances. From a material standpoint, it is reasonable to assume the bilayer as a visco-elastic body accounting for both in-plane fluidity and elasticity. Consequently, lipid rafts contribute to membrane heterogeneity by typically exhibiting higher stiffness and viscosity and by locally altering the bilayer dynamics and proteins activity. A chemo-mechanical model of lipid bilayer coupled with interspecific dynamics among the resident species (typically transmembrane receptors and trasporters) has been recently formulated to explain and predict how proteins regulate the dynamic heterogeneity of membrane. However, the explicit inclusion of the membrane viscosity in the model was not considered. To this aim, the present work enriches the constitutive description of the bilayer by modeling its visco-elastic behavior. This is done through a strain-level dependent viscosity able to theoretically trace back the alteration of membrane fluidity experimentally observed in lipid phase transitions. This provides new insights into how the quasi-solid and fluid components of lipid membrane response interact with the evolution of resident proteins by affecting the activity of raft domains, with effects on cell mechano-signaling.},

abstract = {Flexible magnetic materials have great potential for biomedical and soft robotics applications, but they need to be mechanically robust. An extraordinary material from a mechanical point of view is spider silk. Recently, methods for producing artificial spider silk fibers in a scalable and all-aqueous-based process have been developed. If endowed with magnetic properties, such biomimetic artificial spider silk fibers would be excellent candidates for making magnetic actuators. In this study, we introduce magnetic artificial spider silk fibers, comprising magnetite nanoparticles coated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. The composite fibers can be produced in large quantities, employing an environmentally friendly wet-spinning process. The nanoparticles were found to be uniformly dispersed in the protein matrix even at high concentrations (up to 20% w/w magnetite), and the fibers were superparamagnetic at room temperature. This enabled external magnetic field control of fiber movement, rendering the material suitable for actuation applications. Notably, the fibers exhibited superior mechanical properties and actuation stresses compared to conventional fiber-based magnetic actuators. Moreover, the fibers developed herein could be used to create macroscopic systems with self-recovery shapes, underscoring their potential in soft robotics applications.},

abstract = {Cell membranes, mediator of many biological mechanisms from adhesion and metabolism up to mutation and infection, are highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments exhibiting a strong coupling between biochemical events and structural re-organisation. This involves conformational changes induced, at lower scales, by lipid order transitions and by the micro-mechanical interplay of lipids with transmembrane proteins and molecular diffusion. Particular attention is focused on lipid rafts, ordered lipid microdomains rich of signalling proteins, that co-localise to enhance substance trafficking and activate different intracellular biochemical pathways. In this framework, the theoretical modelling of the dynamic clustering of lipid rafts implies a full multiphysics coupling between the kinetics of phase changes and the mechanical work performed by transmembrane proteins on lipids, involving the bilayer elasticity. This mechanism produces complex interspecific dynamics in which membrane stresses and chemical potentials do compete by determining different morphological arrangements, alteration in diffusive walkways and coalescence phenomena, with a consequent influence on both signalling potential and intracellular processes. Therefore, after identifying the leading chemo-mechanical interactions, the present work investigates from a modelling perspective the spatio-temporal evolution of raft domains to theoretically explain co-localisation and synergy between proteins' activation and raft formation, by coupling diffusive and mechanical phenomena to observe different morphological patterns and clustering of ordered lipids. This could help to gain new insights into the remodelling of cell membranes and could potentially suggest mechanically based strategies to control their selectivity, by orienting intracellular functions and mechanotransduction.},

abstract = {A novel ternary composite system has been developed by combining MXene nanoplatelets with pre-polyurethane (PU) and an epoxy (EP) resin through in-situ polymerization and solution blending. Our approach aims to enhance the strength and toughness of the EP matrix while maintaining its thermal stability. The strong compatibility between isocyanate-terminated PU and hydroxyl-terminated MXene with the resin was demonstrated through chemical grafting and hydrogen bonding processes. In this ternary composite, significant improvements were observed, including a 32 % increase in tensile strength, a 46.4 % increase in flexural strength, and a 13.4 % increase in fracture toughness, even at very low filler contents of 0.05 wt% for MXene and 1 wt% for PU. A thorough examination of the fractured surfaces revealed the underlying mechanisms responsible for the improved strength and toughness. These mechanisms involve a transition from a brittle to a ductile fracture mode, which can be attributed to the combined effects of thermoplastic toughness, strong chemical bonding between PU and EP, and crack-anchoring and bridging effects facilitated by MXene nanoplatelets. The results presented herein are relevant to a wide range of applications in aerospace, automotive, electronics and various other industries where durability and thermomechanical performance of materials are critical.},

abstract = {Scientific and industrial interest in spider silk stems from its remarkable properties, including supercontraction—an activation effect induced by wetting. Understanding the underlying molecular scale mechanisms is then also crucial for biomimetic applications. In this study, it is illustrated how the effective integration of physically-based machine learning with scientific interpretations can lead to significant physical insights and enhance the predictive power of an existing microstructure-inspired model. A symbolic data modeling technique, known as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR), is employed, which integrates regression capabilities with the genetic programming paradigm, enabling the derivation of explicit analytical formulas for deducing structure-function relationships emerging across different scales, to investigate the impact of protein primary structures on supercontraction. This analysis is based on recent multiscale experimental data encompassing a diverse range of scales and a wide variety of different spider silks. Specifically, this analysis reveals a correlation between supercontraction and the repeat length of the MaSp2 protein as well as the polyalanine region of MaSp1. Straightforward microstructural interpretations that align with experimental observations are proposed. The MaSp2 repeat length governs the cross-links that stabilize amorphous chains in dry conditions. When hydrated, these cross-links are disrupted, leading to entropic coiling and fiber contraction. Furthermore, the length of the polyalanine region in MaSp1 plays a critical role in supercontraction by restricting the extent of crystal misalignment necessary to accommodate the shortening of the soft regions. The validation of the model is accomplished by comparing experimental data from the Silkome database with theoretical predictions derived from both the machine learning and the proposed model. The enhanced model offers a more comprehensive understanding of supercontraction and establishes a link between the primary structure of silk proteins and their macroscopic behavior, thereby advancing the field of biomimetic applications.},

This movement permits to absorb tangential impact energy during its movement. A series of seven pads have been used to modify a motorcycle helmet made of two concentrical liners made of polystyrene. The liners have been only connected by pads and therefore are free to rotate. Oblique impacts tests on the helmet have shows a 14% reduction of the brain injury criterion. Moreover, the maximum of the rotational acceleration is moved to longer times, indicating a retard of the acceleration of the head due to the effect of the pads. The novel system can be applied with minimal modifications in most sport and motorbike helmets.},

abstract = {Microneedles hold the potential for enabling shallow skin penetration applications where biomarkers are extracted from the interstitial fluid (ISF) and drugs are injected in a painless and effective manner. To this purpose, needles must have an inner channel. Channeled needles were demonstrated using custom silicon microtechnology, having several needle tip geometries. Nevertheless, all the proposed fabrication sequences are not compatible with mass production based on mature, standard microfabrication techniques. Furthermore, ISF extraction was also demonstrated with channeled needles but under poorly controlled conditions and over long periods of time, the latter being impractical for medical use. A range of factors may impede or slow ISF extraction that require controlled experiments. In this work we address the above tasks in terms of microfabrication sequence design, tip geometry design and experimental validation under controlled conditions. We report the development and fabrication of a silicon channeled microneedle array using conventional, industrial micromechanic processes. With only 2 lithography steps, a hypodermic needle tip profile is achieved. Using the fabricated microneedles, fluid extraction is experimented on chicken skin mockups. Extraction tests are carried out by inducing a controlled pressure gradient between the two ends of the microneedle channels, generated by loading the chip or by applying vacuum to the chip's backside. The extraction of more than 1 $\mu$L of fluid in 20 minutes is demonstrated with a maximum applied pressure gradient of 500 mbar. A correlation between the extraction rate efficiency and needles' density is observed, both for short and long extraction times. These results provide the first demonstration of in vitro interstitial fluid collection under controlled experimental conditions using silicon hollow microneedles fabricated with standard micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technology and minimal steps. Based on the obtained data, a comparison is drawn between pressure load and vacuum as drivers for ISF extraction, according to modelling and controlled experiments.},

abstract = {Spider silks have attracted significant interest due to their exceptional mechanical properties, which include a unique combination of high strength, ultimate strain, and toughness. A notable characteristic of spider silk, still debated from both mechanical and functional viewpoints, is supercontraction –a pronounced contraction of up to half its original length when an unconstrained silk thread is exposed to a wet environment. We propose a predictive model for the hygro-thermo-mechanical behavior of spider silks, conceptualizing this phenomenon as a solid–solid phase transition, similar to the glass transition in rubber, but driven by humidity. As wetting increases, the system undergoes a transition, at the network scale, from a hard, dry state –where the material behavior is governed by stiff chains elongated along the fiber axis– to a soft, wet state, regulated by a rubber-like response. We model these states using a two-well free energy function dependent on molecular stretch, with transition energy modulated by humidity. Based on the methods of Statistical Mechanics, we deduce that supercontraction can be interpreted as a solid–solid phase transition. We elucidate the important role of thermal fluctuations. In particular, the decrease of the critical humidity needed for supercontraction as temperature grows results as an effect of entropic stabilization of the softer rubbery phase. Our model quantitatively predicts the observed experimental behavior, capturing the temperature dependence of humidity-induced supercontraction effects and related cooperative properties.},

abstract = {Adhesion and deadhesion processes at the interface between an object and a substrate are well-established phenomena in the realm of materials science and biophysics. These processes can be profoundly influenced by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon empirically validated through numerous experimental observations. While discrete models have traditionally served as a foundation for understanding this intricate interplay, this paper seeks to bridge the gap between such discrete representations and the continuous models that more accurately reflect experimental scenarios. To achieve this objective, we initially adopt discrete models comprising n elements, selected such that their physical parameters converge towards the continuum limit as n approaches infinity. This thoughtful scaling ensures that the discrete system retains its relevance in the context of continuous media. Leveraging principles from Statistical Mechanics and Griffith-type total energy minimization approaches, we employ this scaled discrete model to investigate the impact of temperature in continuous adhesion phenomena. As a result, we obtain an analytical model to account for the decrease of the decohesion threshold depending on thermal (entropic) energy terms. Interestingly, our approach demonstrates that continuous adhesion models invariably exhibit phase transitions, whose critical temperatures can be derived through closed-form calculations. By elucidating these critical temperature values, this work enhances our understanding of adhesion processes within continuous media and opens new avenues for the exploration of adhesion-related phenomena in diverse scientific disciplines. Finally, the comparison with some experimental results is discussed.},
